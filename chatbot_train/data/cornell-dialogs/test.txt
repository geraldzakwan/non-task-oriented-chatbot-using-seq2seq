I would like to purchase some health insurance.
Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.
Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
Could you explain the difference between HMO and PPO?
To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor.
When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?
The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like.
How much will an HMO cost me per month?
Please go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote.
I am calling to purchase health insurance.
Do you have health insurance now?
I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.
You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
I don't know which I want, an HMO or a PPO.
Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors.
When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?
The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.
How much will a PPO cost me per month?
We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire.
I need information on purchasing health insurance.
Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
This is my first time buying health insurance.
You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?
I am not sure what HMO and PPO are.
Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?
By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?
We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.
Good morning, is this Papaya?
You are speaking with Papaya. How can I help you?
Papaya, this is Malia, and I need to call in sick today.
What seems to be the problem?
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak.
When did you get that?
I think I got it on Saturday, but it just showed up today.
What are you doing for it?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot.
Good. You probably should be much better by tomorrow.
May I speak to Papaya, please?
This is Papaya you are speaking with. What can I do for you?
Hi, Papaya, this is Malia, and I will not be coming to work today.
What is wrong with you?
I have really bad poison oak and can't stop itching.
How long have you had it?
I've had it a few days, but the rash really got bad last night.
How have you been treating it?
I have some lotion that the doctor gave me, as well as an antihistamine.
That should work. I'll see you tomorrow when you return to work.
I would like to speak with Papaya.
This is Papaya. How may I help you?
Papaya, this is Malia, and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather.
Do you know what the problem is?
I have a horrible rash from poison oak.
Have you had it a long time?
The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days.
Have you been using anything for it?
I bought some over-the-counter lotion, and I am taking an antihistamine.
That will probably take care of your symptoms. I'll see you tomorrow.
I have a doctor's appointment scheduled with Dr. Smith, and I need to change it.
What day did you have it scheduled for?
My appointment was on Tuesday.
What time was it scheduled for?
It was for two o'clock in the afternoon.
I see your appointment. What day would you like to switch to?
I would like to switch it to next Friday.
What time would you like?
I would like to come in at 10:00 in the morning.
Fine, I will pencil that in right now. We will see you then.
I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Smith, and I can't make it on that day.
What day was your appointment on?
My appointment was on Monday.
What time had you chosen?
It was for 10:00 in the morning.
I am looking at your appointment right now. What day would you prefer?
I would prefer next Thursday.
What time would be best for you?
I want to come in at 2:00 in the afternoon.
I am writing you down for that time. We look forward to seeing you.
Good morning, I made an appointment with Dr. Smith, but I have to change it.
When you made your appointment, what day did you choose?
My appointment was on Wednesday.
At what time was that appointment?
It was for 4:00 in the afternoon.
I can see the appointment that you had. What day do you need to change to?
I want to change to next Tuesday.
What time would you prefer?
I would prefer three o'clock in the afternoon.
I will put you down for that time. Thank you for calling to reschedule.
Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the emergency room.
Of course. What is the problem?
I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my stomach.
If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there if you fall asleep.
I can do that when I get off of the phone.
Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?
I already had them out before I called you.
Where is your nearest emergency room?
It's just a few blocks away.
Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.
I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me get to the emergency room?
We will come right over. What happened?
My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash!
Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall asleep before I get there.
I will do that in a minute, and make sure you can get in.
Also make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we can grab them.
I know right where they both are.
Is there an emergency room near you?
It is on the other side of town, next to city hall.
I am on my way. Give me ten minutes and I'll get to you.
I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the emergency room.
I will take you there right away. What is wrong?
I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105!
I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the back door right now, that would be great.
I will make sure that I do that before you get here.
Also, make sure that we have your driver's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room.
I am getting them out while I am speaking to you.
Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?
It is near the bridge that crosses over the river.
I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there!
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received.
Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
It was for my Master Card.
You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.
I haven't got it in the mail yet.
The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.
What am I supposed to do about my bill then?
Maybe you should call your post office.
But if it's their mistake, can I get an extension on my bill payment?
Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.
Thank you very much for your help.
No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.
I haven't received my credit card bill yet.
Which credit card are you speaking of?
My Master Card.
We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago.
I never got it.
Your bill was mailed already.
What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill?
If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.
Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault?
If that's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake.
Thanks for everything.
Don't mention it. Call back if you have any more problems.
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got.
Which credit card was the bill for?
The bill was for my Master Card.
That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago.
It never came in the mail.
My computer shows that it has already been mailed.
I have not gotten my bill, so what should I do about that?
You should try contacting your post office.
If it is the post office's fault, may I have an extension on my bill?
You'll have to prove it was their error; then you can get an extension.
Thank you for all your help.
You are very welcome. Have a good day.
There's a problem with my credit card.
Tell me what the problem is.
A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make.
What was the charge for?
The charge was for a $350 purse, but I did not buy it.
Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase?
I would know if I bought something that expensive.
I apologize. What day was this purchase made?
It was bought on November 12th at 3:15 pm, while I was at work.
All right, we'll do an investigation.
Until this investigation is finished, will I have to pay for the charge?
No, you don't. We'll take care of it.
I have a problem with my credit card.
What's wrong with it?
There is a charge on my card that I didn't make.
Can you tell me what the charge was?
It's for a purse that cost $350.
Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse?
I can't even afford a purse that expensive.
I'm very sorry. When was this purchase made?
I was at work, but the purchase was made at 3:15 on November 12th.
We're going to investigate this claim.
Do I have to pay for this charge?
You won't have to pay for anything.
There is something wrong with my credit card.
What's the problem?
There is a charge on here that I never made.
What charge was made?
It was a charge for a $350 purse that I never bought.
You didn't make this purchase?
I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large.
Sorry. When was this purse purchased?
It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3:15 pm, but I was at work.
We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, do I have to pay for this charge?
No. We'll take care of everything.
I would like to order cable.
Sure, what package do you want?
What kinds of packages do you offer?
We have all kinds of movie channel packages.
What else do you have?
There is a package for all sports channels.
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also?
Yes, we do offer that package.
I want that.
Do you want anything else?
No, but is it possible for me to add channels later?
You can always get rid of channels or add some later.
I want to get some cable.
Do you know what package you want to get?
What packages do you have?
We have movie channel packages.
What else have you got?
You can get the sports package.
Is there a package with basic and movie channels?
We have that package.
Let me get that package.
Is there anything else you would like?
That's everything, but can I add channels later?
You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day.
May I order some cable from you today?
Okay, what package would you like to order?
I'm not sure of what packages you offer.
We offer packages with all the movie channels.
Are there any other packages?
We also have packages with all the sports channels.
I want a package that has the basic and movie channels.
We have that available.
I would like to get that.
Would you like anything else with your package?
That's it, but will I be able to add more channels at another time?
Yes, you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like.
I would like to order some internet today.
What kind would you like?
What kind of internet is there?
You can get DSL or dial-up.
Which of those two is best?
I would recommend DSL.
Is that one better?
It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
What do you mean by that?
DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet?
That's correct. With DSL you can do both.
I need to get internet.
Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
What kind of internet can I get?
There is dial-up or DSL.
Which one do you feel is best?
I would get DSL if I were you.
DSL is better than dial-up?
It's the best choice; plus, it won't tie up your phone line.
I'm not sure what that means.
Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
That'll make it impossible for me to use.
Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.
I'd like to have internet for my computer.
Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
What are my options for the internet?
You can either get dial-up or DSL.
Which one would you recommend?
DSL is the best choice.
Why is DSL better?
It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
What exactly does that mean?
Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right?
That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.
I am calling about my cable service.
What's the problem?
For the past week my cable hasn't been working.
I apologize, but the cable has been down lately.
Do you know when it is going to start working again?
Give it a couple days, and it should be back on.
Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working?
Since it's not working, I'm going to give you a credit.
So I don't have to pay anything?
You won't pay anything until your service starts working again.
Okay, thank you very much for your help.
No problem. Thank you for being so understanding.
I have a question about my cable.
What do you need?
I haven't been able to use my cable service for the past week.
Right now the cable isn't working.
Could you tell me when the cable will be back on?
The cable should be running again in a couple of days.
In the meantime, do I still have to pay for the cable?
We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience.
Does that mean I won't have to pay for it?
It'll be free until it comes back on.
Thanks, I appreciate your help.
Thank you for all your patience.
I have a problem with my cable.
What about it?
My cable has been out for the past week or so.
The cable is down right now. I am very sorry.
When will it be working again?
It should be back on in the next couple of days.
Do I still have to pay for the cable?
We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down.
So, I don't have to pay for it?
No, not until your cable comes back on.
Thanks for everything.
You're welcome, and thank you for your understanding.
I need somebody to come over and fix my internet.
What's wrong with it?
For some reason it's just not connecting.
How long have you been having this problem?
It hasn't been working the past few days.
Does the internet come up at all?
It does, but it won't connect to anything.
Well, the internet isn't down, so there must be something wrong with your connection.
Could you send someone to fix it today?
I'll send somebody over right away to fix it.
When will they be here?
They should be there in the next hour.
I need to get my internet fixed.
What's the problem with your internet?
It won't connect.
How long has this been happening?
This connection problem has been happening for a few days now.
The internet doesn't come up at all?
It just won't connect to a webpage, but it will pop up.
There's obviously a problem with your connection.
I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me.
I can send somebody right now to fix it.
How long will it take for them to get here?
They'll be there in about an hour.
Can you send someone to fix my internet?
Are you having a problem with it?
My internet is having problems connecting.
Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up?
I've been having this problem for the last few days.
Will the internet even pop up?
It'll pop up, but it won't connect to a webpage.
Since the internet isn't broken, your connection must be messed up.
Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it?
If you'd like, I can send someone to fix it right now.
How long will it be till they get here?
It should be no longer than an hour.
I am interested in buying auto insurance.
Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
Yes, I brought everything with me.
Is your car with you?
Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
What else do I need to consider for the auto insurance?
Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well.
Good morning, I need to buy car insurance for the used car I just bought.
Yes, no problem. Do you have your registration and Certificate of Ownership with you?
Yes, it is all right here.
Did you drive your car here?
Yes, it is out in the back.
That's great. We'll go out and check the condition of your car.
I understand, what should I insure my car for?
There is a Blue Book price for your car and we will use that price.
What other things do I need to insure for?
We will factor in damage to the other car as well as property damage and injury.
I just bought a used car and need to insure it.
We can take care of that right now. Do you have all of your paperwork with you?
Yes, I took care of all of that and have the papers with me.
Did you bring your car with you?
Yes, it is parked on the street.
Fine, I need to go out with you to check your car for wear and tear.
Fine, how will I know how much I should insure my car for?
After looking at your car, I will use the Blue Book price and we will consider the condition of the car.
Are there other considerations when I insure my car?
We always need to think about property damage, damage to other vehicles, and injury.
What kind of car insurance do you have?
I went with the Automobile Club.
Why did you choose that company?
I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
What should I think about in choosing services?
There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
What did you end up buying for your auto insurance?
Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.
Have you ever had to use your insurance?
I never had to use my insurance.
When you insured your car, what kind did you buy?
I decided to buy from GEICO.
What influenced your choice of companies?
I looked at the customer satisfaction rating of the company.
How did you figure out what services to buy?
Every individual has different considerations. Your agent can help you understand what you need to think about.
What did you place an emphasis on when you bought your insurance?
I carry a lot of liability insurance because I own a house and need to protect it from a lawsuit.
Did you ever get into an accident and need your insurance?
I was in an accident and was happy that I had good insurance to cover it.
What car insurance company did you decide to go with when you bought your new car?
State Farm seemed like the best deal for me.
How did you make that decision?
I compared rates and services available.
Where can I get help in figuring out what I need to purchase for coverage?
You can pick up a pamphlet at your insurance company that will explain the options to you.
What did you decide to cover yourself for?
I pretty much carry the average amount in all categories as the agent recommended.
How many times have you actually used your insurance?
I was in an accident, but it was the other person's fault and their insurance covered it.
I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.
Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?
I already took care of that yesterday.
That's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?
Yes, I think we've agreed upon a fair price.
Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?
Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.
That's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive your car home?
That would be a great help!
Glad to be of help.
That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.
From what I see, it's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?
A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.
It's good that you took care of that. Have you agreed upon a price with the seller?
Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that.
Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?
Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union.
You are very well prepared! I could go with you to talk to the seller and help you get your car home.
I appreciate the offer of help!
It would be my pleasure to help you.
I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.
It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take a look at it just to be sure.
My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.
That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a price?
Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.
Have you thought about how to pay for your car?
I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.
You've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment and drive your car home for you.
That would make it a lot easier for me.
I am glad that can help. Let's go take care of that right now.
I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?
I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
How long have you been in your current home?
I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.
What is the next step in selling my home?
I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.
I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When were you thinking of selling your home?
I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own.
Have you owned your home for a long time?
I just bought my home two years ago.
I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract.
I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.
It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you interested in selling in the near future?
I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii.
Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away.
Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.
Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?
It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
What should we be doing to get the process started?
If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.
Thank you for coming to look at my house.
I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.
When will people come to look at my house?
Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.
Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office?
Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
Will I know when people are going to come see my house?
We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
What happens during an Open House day?
You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the details.
I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.
It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.
How do you show my home to potential buyers?
We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.
Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?
We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
How will I know when to expect prospective house buyers?
That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours notice.
Can I stay home during an Open House day?
The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle the showing of your home.
Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.
I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.
When can people come and see my home?
We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show your house during the week.
Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers?
Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.
Can people just drop in anytime they feel like the house?
We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.
Will I have to go away during an Open House day?
I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else!
How much do you think that I should ask for my house?
Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
What do you look at when setting an asking price for the house?
We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?
Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?
The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth.
Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home?
You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?
You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?
We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.
What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
What is involved in figuring out an asking price?
We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?
You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.
Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers?
If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it.
I am interested in buying a house and need some information.
Yes, of course. What area are you interested in?
I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia.
What size house would you like?
We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
Are you interested in being in a particular school district?
Yes, we want to stay in the ABC School District.
Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view?
I would love to have a home with a view.
Fine, I will begin a search for the perfect home for you. I will call you in a few days.
I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you.
I can help you. What location are you looking for?
I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia.
Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size?
We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.
Is living in a particular school district important to you?
No, we don't really care because they are all pretty good around here.
Are you interested in purchasing on the lake, or would you like a home with a view?
We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat.
Now that I have an idea of what you want, I can begin my search.
I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.
I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house?
I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions.
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home.
Do you need to be located in a particular school district?
It doesn't matter, as we do not have any children.
Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?
In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.
Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.
I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?
My name is John Sandals.
Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days do you need that reservation, sir?
I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17.
Our room rates recently went up. Is that okay with you, sir?
How much per night are we talking about?
Each night will be $308.
That price is perfectly acceptable.
Wonderful! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room?
Nonsmoking, please.
Next question: Is a queen-size bed okay?
Queen-size sounds fine to me.
Okay, sir. Your reservation is in our computer. All we need now is a phone number.
Certainly. My phone number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you, sir. We look forward to seeing you here!
Hi there, I want to reserve a hotel room.
No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please?
Sure, My name is John Sandals.
Hi, Mr. Sandals. I'm Papaya, at your service. When do you need the room?
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th.
We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
It's $308 a night.
I have no problem with that.
Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Definitely nonsmoking. I can't handle that smell.
Nonsmoking. Now, is a queen-size bed okay?
No problem. Queen-size sounds good to me.
Great, sir. Your reservation is confirmed. Now all I need is your phone number.
Of course! The phone number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you so much, sir. We look forward to seeing you!
I need to reserve a room.
Not a problem. May I have your name, please?
Of course. I'm John Sandals.
Hi, sir. My name is Papaya. Could you tell me when you need the room?
Right now. I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th.
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates. Do you find that acceptable, sir?
Maybe. How much is a room?
The price per night is $308.
That sounds fine to me.
Fantastic! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?
I hate cigarettes! Nonsmoking.
That'll be nonsmoking. Now, do you approve of a single queen-size bed?
That'll be no problem.
I'm happy to hear that, sir. Your reservation is all set except for your phone number.
Sure! My number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you for doing business with us, and we look forward to seeing you!
I need a hotel room.
That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please?
Certainly. My name is John Sandals.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days will you need a room?
Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17.
One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that acceptable, sir?
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
It'll be $308 nightly.
That's a reasonable price.
Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking.
I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay?
A queen sounds great.
Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me your phone number.
That would be 305-555-1788.
Ok, I got it. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!
I need a room for a few days.
That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name?
My name is John Sandals.
Sir, I'm Papaya, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be here.
I'll be there in April: Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th.
We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price?
The price will be $308 a night.
That price is not bad for me.
Very good. Now sir, about the room, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, definitely!
Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay?
Yes, that'll be just fine.
One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is your phone number.
It's 305-555-1788.
Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
Can I reserve a hotel room?
I assure you, that's not a problem. What is your full name, please?
My name's John Sandals.
It's a pleasure to assist you. Please tell me when you'll be needing the room, sir.
If my plans don't change, I'll need a room April 14 till April 17.
Sir, our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will that be okay?
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
$308 a night? That's a fair price.
Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, please.
Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?
I have absolutely no problem with that.
Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just give me your phone number.
Not a problem. The number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you for making a reservation with us. We look forward to seeing you!
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.
Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What is this blood test for?
Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.
What does the blood test result tell him?
Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.
Will the blood test hurt?
It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up.
Ouch!

My doctor says that I need a blood test.
I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What are you taking my blood for?

What information does the blood test give him?
If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection somewhere in your body.
Is a blood test painful?
I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein. It will only feel like a little pin prick.
My God, that hurts!
That was it! Thank you for coming in today.
I came to this lab to have my blood drawn.
You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat.
What am I being tested for?
Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is.
What does my white blood cell count tell him?
Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection.
How much will the blood test hurt?
It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find.
Is that my blood going into that tube?
That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for coming in!

So, I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical.
Yes, I am playing on the tennis team this year, and they are requiring me to get a physical exam.
We are basically going to check your heart, lungs, blood sugar levels, and eyes, ears, and nose.
I've kind of been having problems being out of breath. Can you look at that?
Yes, I will check you for asthma, and maybe we can check you for allergies later.
Thank you. What will the blood test tell you?
We will be checking for blood sugar, cholesterol, and white blood cell count.
I have been working hard to stay healthy. I hope the tests turn out well.
So how are we feeling today?
Things are going well for me.

Yes, I am applying for new health insurance, and I need a physical examination to qualify.
Your basic physical exam will include lungs, heart, blood levels, and eyes, ears, and nose.
I've been having a little trouble breathing. Would you look into that, please?
We can do an allergy test, and later I can send you for an asthma test.
I would appreciate it. When you give me a blood test, what are you looking for?

I am expecting the tests to go well. I have been taking good care of myself.
Nice to see you. How have you been feeling lately?

Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems.
We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should be.
I've been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that?
I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion.
That would be great. What is the blood test for?
The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar.
I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly.

Oh, thank you. I will take care of myself.

Thank you for reminding me. I will try to behave myself.
I can just imagine , being around so much money all the time
Gambling 's not about money .
How did you know I was here ?
I thought you would n't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here .
I do n't want a criminal for a boyfriend .
There was a message , was n't there ?
It 's probably easier for you to eat the rice .
Marion ! What did you tell the police ?
For Christ 's sake , Jacko , do n't look a gift horse in the mouth . Have you written that name down ? Reynolds , at the Golden Lion .
All right , dad . Yes , I 'll call him .
So how are you doing , dad ?
Great . I 've just started a new company . Solid financing . It 's good . I love you Jacko , you know that
It 's against the rules . Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters .
That 's stupid . What are the odds of you being seen with me ?
I 'm not much of a gambler really . I just like this bar .
So why did you come to my casino ?
And the lies . Gamblers are born liars .
And superstitious too . It 's like witchcraft .
That 's Africa . There 's an African in all of us , is n't there ?
We all came from Africa , supposedly .
That trick tonight , I do n't think I 've ever seen that before .
It can only work with amateurs , A pro would have spotted it .
I know that . But you can now .
I do n't have any money . switches on the light . JANI is looking distressed .
My creditors . One night , around three in the morning , they 'll come into the casino -
Forget it , Jani . It 'll never work .
The point is , they want a man inside .
And I thought you were a bright woman .
And I thought you were only after my body .
I 've come to know you . You 're honest . I trust you .
I want to go back to Cape Town , I want to start again , clean .
I ca n't do it , Jani .
Did they tell you to sleep with me ?
I told you , all bets are off .
It does n't seem fair . You 're offering me ten grand in cash but you ca n't afford a decent place .
Well , life 's not fair . We know that .
I do n't think we should meet again .
It 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you .
I 'm a witch . A white witch . Why do n't we move on ?
Are you going to put a spell on me ?
Nice car . How much did you pay for it ?
Too much . Eighteen hundred .
Coming up to two years now . But I was away for six months .
You 've done pretty well .
I 'm off to a little watering hole . Why do n't you join me ? Relax .
No thanks , Matt . I need my eight hours .
I do n't get you . Even if it was true , which it is n't , what the fuck difference would it make to you ?
Because if a supervisor knew I 'd seen you and I had n't reported it , I 'd lose my job as well . And I ca n't afford that .
Vodka . Straight . On the rocks .
Good call . Help yourself .
I 'm off . I need to sleep .
Loosen up , Jack . If you do n't , this job 'll get to you . The pressure 's too much , believe me , it 'll break you .
What ? You know what happened to me , do n't you ? That bitch Bella shopped me . I 'd like to beat the shit out of her .
I 'd like to buy you a drink .
I 'm sorry , sir , that 's a late bet .
What are you talking about ? It 's 11 , I 've won . With this lady .
You 've won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
I put them on together .
You do n't recognise me ? You had me barred . You fucking little worm .
Wait a minute . You got yourself barred .
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond .
We check every four days .
Why four ? And not three or five ?
It 's the procedure here . Now sort the chips .
Not with your own cloth . Besides , your pockets will be stitched .
What happens if I want to sneeze ?
This is n't South Africa . We 'd know , because someone would report it . Believe me , someone always does .
Does know ? Or does report ? What would happen if I knew something like that and did n't report it ?
Why do n't you take a break , Jack .
All right , Mr Reynolds .
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand .
Right , that checks out here .
Ninety seven million , minus eight , corrected to mass critical .
I read that with a quantum increase of seven .
The one on unit oh , I think it 's GMR twelve zero zero .
Oh . What 's wrong now ?
I 'm not sure . I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship , though .
I hope it 's not the oven again .
Where is it ? What did you do with it ?
I do n't have it . I do n't know where it is .
The key , goddamit , the key !
Christ , twenty seconds , Christ !
We 've got to disarm the bomb .
Doolittle , are you there ?
What was that , I did n't hear
It 's Talby . He 's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack .
Well now what ? What do , you have for us now . Boiler ?
Not much . Nothing at all in this sector .
Hey , Doolittle , here 's one . An unstable planet . 85 % probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star .
Sounds good . Chart a course for the Veil Nebula .
Why does n't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us ?
He just likes it up in the dome , that 's all .
Talby , Talby , can you read me ?
Can you beat that ? I always knew Talby was weird .
Swell . Let 's synchronize detonation time . Do you know when you 're supposed to go off ?
Detonation in six minutes , twenty seconds .
Fail safe in lock . Four minutes to drop , 22 minutes to detonation . This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb # 20 . Do you read me , bomb ?
Bomb # 20 to Sergeant Pinback . Roger , I read you , continue .
But you ca n't explode in the bomb bay . It 's foolish . You 'll kill us all . There 's no reason for it .
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . Detonation will occur at the programmed time .
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb # 20 . I repeat previous order , you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay . Do you understand ?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds . Detonation will occur at the programmed time .
Bomb , this is Doolittle . You are not to detonate , repeat , you are not to detonate in the bomb bay . Disarm yourself . This is an order .
I read you , Lieutenant Doolittle , but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes . Detonation will occur at the programmed time .
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?
I am always receptive to suggestions .
Hmm Well , I think , therefore I am .
That 's good . Very good . Now then , how do you know that anything else exists ?
Why do n't you have more time ?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds .
Now , bomb , consider this next question , very carefully . What is your one purpose in life ?
To explode , of course .
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate .
I recall distinctly the detonation order . My memory is good on matters like these .
Yeah . Eight , it says here .
Any of 'em any good ?
The new star . What are you gon na name it ?
Who cares . Do n't bother me .
Hello , Pinback , are you there ?
Yeah , Doolittle . What 's up ?
You know , Talby , you really ought to eat with the rest of us . You spend too much time up here .
I like it up here .
Must get lonely being up here so much .
I do n't like to go below since Commander Powell died . I feel enclosed down there . If it were big enough , I 'd sleep up here
You know what I think about , Talby ?
I 'm getting something here , on this readout
It 's funny , but I kind of sit around , you know , a lot of time to myself
I think I 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere .
Ah , Doolittle , I do have a malfunction on this readout , but I ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .
Do n't worry about it . We 'll find out when it goes bad .
I really think I should try and locate it immediately . Might be something important .
I wish I had my board with me now . Even if I could only polish it once in awhile .
Lieutenant Doolittle , this is Talby . Lieutenant ?
Yes , Talby , what is it ?
Doolittle , Doolittle , where are you ?
Here I am . I think I 'm spinning We 're both falling , Talby , in opposite directions , away from each other . My my jetpack 's gone .
Before we get too far away , and our signals start to fade , I just wanted to tell you you were my favorite . I really liked you , Doolittle .
I really liked you too , Talby . Hey , some debris from the ship ! It 's coming right by me .
Commander Powell , this is Doolittle . Ah , there 's something serious come up , sir , and I have to ask you something .
I 'm glad you 've come to talk with me , Doolittle . It 's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me .
Well , sir , the Dodgers broke up , disbanded over thirteen years ago .
Ah pity , pity
You do n't understand , sir , we ca n't get the bomb to drop .
Ah , so many malfunctions why do n't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me ? Oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
What should we do , sir ? The time is running out .
Well , what you might try is
We 're running out of time , sir .
Oh , yes Well , Doolittle , if you ca n't get it to drop you 'll have to talk to it .
I already have , sir , and Pinback is talking to it now .
No , no , Doolittle , you talk to it . Teach it Phenomenology , Doolittle .
Men men what happened , men ?
Yeah , the skipper always was lucky .
Okay , okay . I can explain You ever have to do something you really do n't want to ?
How I make my living , what 's your point ?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras . He wants you to come see him .
I 'm on a break .
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is .
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is .
Look , that thing about the pliers , I was just doing what the man pays me to do . Ya know ? Comin ' off hard .
Yeah , sure , I understand .
Man , you got a bad attitude .
I like to keep it professional , that 's all .
Fine . So call her . Get her over here .
Actually , that 's not gon na be necessary .
See what you do n't know is you 're already in the last two minutes of your life .
You 're in the last two seconds , you do n't cut the crap .
You can hardly blame him , the way you 've been taking care of business or should I say , not taking care of it .
What 're you talkin ' about ?
This is what your life 's worth , Bruno .
But the boss knows I always been loyal .
Ass like your , I can see why he 's worried you 'll punk .
What the hell are you doing ?
Some of us are trying to sleep .
You did n't tell me you lived with her .
How 're ya doin ' , Max .
You mean until you showed up ?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend ? Who would take offense to that ?
Justine was not an unwilling participant .
Which is none of your business or mine .
It concerns only Jah . But , in this case , I was the instrument of the Most High .
What 're you lookin ' at me for ? I 'm not his next of kin . Anyway , I do n't got that kind of cash lyin ' around .
Theo rode for this place a long time , man .
Must think you 're pretty special laying this on you .
Thought so . Turned out he wanted me for something else though .
I should n't do this . But I got a client lookin ' to score some fire power . Maybe you 'll keep your eyes open for me .
I do n't get involved with guns .
I made you coffee . That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little .
Thanks , it 's starting to kick in . I feel almost human .
What 's with you ? Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he 's family .
Just thought maybe he 'd like a little coffee with his saliva .
Oh my God ! In here ! IN HERE !
SHHH ! Do n't do that !
Your daughter 's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet .
Can you help me get her back ?
Goodnight Bears . Goodnight chairs . Goodnight kittens . Goodnight mittens . Goodnight clocks . And goodnight socks . Goodnight little house . And goodnight
I do n't want to move away .
I know , Honey , but just think how exiting it will be new house , new school , new friends
But why ca n't we stay here ?
Because we ca n't . There 's nothing here for us anymore .
Are we in some kind of trouble ?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying . But things will be better when we move to a new place .
Then I 'm gon na do what you do to make me feel better when I 'm sad .
I 'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time .
We 're just a little tense right now It 's okay .
So , what , you liked it because it was shiny ?
No , because it 's the Egyptian goddess Bast .
So this guy walks into a bar and says
We did n't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night .
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention ?
Now you know who I am , where I live . I figured I better find out who I 'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me .
How does Mrs . Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody 's hit list ?
Lauren 's not my wife .
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time ?
I wo n't be staying .
How do I know you did n't ?
So saw my hands off , I left you a present .
Whoa there , Tex ! We 've been through all this .
It 's alright , Peter , we 're fine .
I 'm sorry . It was n't my intention . But I had to see you .
You 'd think a guy who 's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl .
I have n't been able to get you off my mind .
You need to get out more .
Gold leaf , art nouveau , French , early nineteen hundreds I could probably fence this for three or four grand .
No , I meant this .
Not that I do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ?
The bar code on your neck , Max . I know who you are and I know who you 're running from .
We got separated right away . I never knew how many made it .
How well do you remember the lab ?
I know they made me . Even got the label on my neck to prove it .
The technical term for you is chimera
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives , just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people .
Like extra virgin olive oil , the best of the best .
That 's low , but this effects me how exactly ?
She 's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa 's managers . You know who Sonrisa is ?
I did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .
She 's put her life on the line , and her faith in me .
They 've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way .
You 're a soldier , Max . That 's what you were put here for . But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up .
I would 've come sooner , but I did n't How 're you doin ' ?
Not in any pain the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord .
It turned up on the black market . One of my sources thought I might be interested .
I do n't know what to say .
You are involved . By being alive you 're involved .
We 're quoting Mom again .
Max something . I got no clue where she stays .
Any idea when she 'll be back ?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night .
With me , where he 's been after work , three , sometimes four nights a week for the last two months We have what you might call an intimate relationship .
Look , I do n't know what you want
I thought it was important for you to know the facts .
Well , it 's over between you and him . We 're getting married next month .
How sweet . Standing by your man , even after what he did . You 're a very understanding person .
Big part of loving someone 's being able to forgive them .
You 're also a fool .
This is not a place you wan na go .
Let go of my hand .
Whoever tossed this place wants you . And I 'm looking to stay outta the line of fire .
How 's this about me ?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery . But there 's a bug in my computer keyboard , a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture .
Like you said , maybe somebody 's tracking one of your investigations .
I need a favor I need you to trace a number for me .
Sure you wan na be havin ' this conversation over the phone ?
At least he did n't swing with your ride .
No , but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day , know what I 'm saying ?
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him .
What guys do . 'Nother order .
You 're way more philosophical than I could ever be .
I just do n't go in with any expectations .
Tell me the truth . Am I a female fog bank ?
You 're not seriously buying into Darren 's nonsense .
If I knew what you were saying , I would n't be asking .
How long you and me known each other ?
Because you 're probably my closest friend in the whole world .
And back at ya . Only there 's a part of you that 's I do n't know
You 're actually gon na bail Sketchy out .
Yeah , 'cause maybe he 's learned his lesson .
Friends do n't help other friends cheat .
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes .
Yeah , I can see to it your winning streak continues .
I 'll bet you can . Sit .
Right after you change your wardrobe , your personality and drop about thirty pounds .
Quite a mouth on a girl so young but my guess is talking is not what it does best .
Only way you 're ever gon na find out is reincarnation Fact is , you are gon na pay me , and I am gon na provide you with a service .
I actually know how this works .
Can you put that in a bag or something ?
You get it when I get her .
It 's payday , need me to pick up your check ?
You 're the best , Maxie .
Probably a touch of what 's going around .
I know what I got , Max . They put me back on that drug they 're giving the other vets . Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff 's no good .
Do n't believe everything you hear on TV .
What if he 's on the level ?
Quitting time . Grab a cold one ?
I got ta meet Natalie for dinner .
Or do you think we 're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we 'll look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending .
Lame , self-serving , arrogant guilty as charged .
Here it comes . The part where the guy turns everything around .
I 'm the victim here .
Then a sympathetic mouth , then a sympathetic
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie . Now , this person 's demanding I blow her off or she 'll do it for me by telling Nat about us .
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ?
I 'm a toy to her .
Fight fire with fire . Threaten to go to her husband .
Who either does n't care , or could have me killed . Either way , Natalie 's still gon na find out .
What happens if you level with her ?
Even if she does n't dump me , which is unlikely , she 'd never be able to trust me again .
So you 're straight on how this is gon na go down .
You set up on Lydia . When she 's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up . I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie .
I just do n't want Natalie to ever find out . She deserves better .
How 'd you get her out of town ?
No , I 'm serious . That psycho got exactly what she deserved Yes .
Lydia may not have been one of humanity 's finer specimens but
She 's toxic monster in bed , but toxic .
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she 's the villain in the piece You are .
You tell Theo he 's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job .
I do n't know how to break this to you , Normal , we 're all looking for another job .
Right , well , thanks for the drinks and stuff , Amanda , but there 's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore .
Do n't be so glum , Hawk . The night 's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities .
Well . Obviously no one you have to worry about Woody .
My name 's not Woody , it 's Haw-haw
No , I mean you love your son ?
More than anything in the world .
And he loves you back , does n't he ?
He 's a little spoiled , but I know he does .
You kidding ? This is Detroit . Drink ?
Yeah , a man 's drink
Sure , I have . But not one with ice in it , that 's all .
Save your money , stud muffin . The lady at the end of the bar sends her love .
Oh , Dicky , I c-c-ca n't
You 're not gon na chicken out on me now , are you ? We 've got your KISS song playing and everything .
I did n't mean for that to be so intense . Forgive me .
I do n't care . I wan na hear more .
I 've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you , Jeremiah . I 've just always been too scared to show it .
Beth , I ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how I 've always felt about you Call me Jam . It 's my band name .
Ann Arbor is n't that far from Cleveland , right ?
Nah . Once I get my own wheels , I could come up all the time .
I feel like such an idiot . Why did n't I just say something a year and a half ago ? Man , think of how much time we wasted .
Let 's not think about the past . Let 's just think about from today on . I 'll never forget you , Jam .
Tease ? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids ?
You got in the car , did n't you ?
What was that D.J . 's name again ?
Oh , I 'll remember it till the day I die . His name was Simpleton the Simian ? No , Samson Samoan No , simply , similar
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead .
Stellas . I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs .
Yeah , she gives you shit and you take it .
Okay , enough . Enough . Gim me the tickets . I wan na hold onto them .
But but , St. Bernard 's is way the hell over in the next county !
So ? Your mom 's car has a CB , radar detector and cruise control , check ?
Ok , dudes , follow my lead .
Wait a minute . We ditching the rest of school ?
Now , how are we gon na do this ?
Gim me a second , dudes . Lem me think .
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car .
Next stop : the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City !
I think we should try sneaking in .
Four dudes sneaking in ? We 'd get busted fer sure . Bad plan .
No You do n't think ?
Nah . Could n't be .
Are you gettin ' wise with me ?
No , I 'm dumber than a goddamn slug . Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?
Dude , this is all I got .
Sorry , man , no can do . But I 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy .
Do n't worry about it . They 're perfectly safe . We can pick them up after school . My mom wo n't be home . It 's no problem .
All right . After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City .
Do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ?
What ? ! Are you mentally deranged , Jam ?
Oh no , Jam . I 'm not falling for that twice .
Well , could n't you slow down so I can at least state my case , Hawk ? If you do n't like it , you can speed up and I 'll never mention it again .
Hey , Look at the front entrance ! A car 's pulling out . The parking space from heaven . God is surely smiling down upon us tonight , dudes .
Kind of funny , I thought He 'd be pissed as hell at me .
Oh , I 'm sorry , Trip . What you made was a big , brainless , pile of horse shit . No offense .
Guys , GUYS ! Come on , if this is anyone 's fault , it 's mine . I was the one who grabbed Trip 's jacket by mistake . It 's my fault and I apologize .
Wait ! I know how we can get in !
Jam , shut-up ! You 're not allowed to speak , remember ? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four . I do n't wan na hear it .
But my plan involves all four of us acting together .
See you at 8:30 , Jam . Later . Dudes ? Later .
Grounded for the rest of the year ?
You 're a smart boy , Jeremiah . And so handsome .
Someday you 'll have a son just like you , Jeremiah . A boy who lies through his teeth , buys demonic records , and smokes the dope just like you .
If I 'm anything like you , I 'll deserve him .
Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . This is my first confession in well a really long time .
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance . How many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
Okay , you better have something really sinful for me this time , son . My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute .
Alright , Father , here it is . About two weeks ago I went to my cousin 's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath .
Tell you what . You keep guessing and I 'll say something when you get it .
Splendid ! I love a good game of Name That Nightie .
Trip , a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make . And even if it did , at least my mom did n't give birth to me while she was on LSD .
Shrooms ! And even if it was LSD , I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day .
That 's some sick shit right there . Did she comb your ass hair for you too ?
If your mom so much as smells those tickets , they 're history , and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row , the third year !
Well , here we are back at fucking school again .
Huh . St. Bernard 's . Figures it 's named after a canine .
Man , that weed knocked Christine on her ass . She 's sleeping like a baby stella .
Let 's lift up her shirt .
Please sir , do n't beat me up . I do have a KISS ticket , but not on me .
A likely story . Hand it over , kid .
Hey , kid , that 's okay . I do n't wan na see KISS that ba
Do n't try to run , maggot . Chongo 's an all-state track star in every event .
Look , you can have my wallet
It 's not nearly enough , punk .
Do n't tempt me , I 'll shoot !
Not if I shoot first !
Simple Simon on the Rock , go caller .
Hello ? Is this me ? I 'm Trip . Am I on the air ?
Hi what 's going on here ?
Horrible accident . My neighbour he got killed .
So according to Hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time .
So in order to travel back in time , you 'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light
What effect do you think this would have on an infant ?
Well the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . And anyone who says they do is lying . We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie ? He stinks .
When you fall asleep tonight , I 'm gon na fart in your face .
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this , Samantha ?
You 'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal .
The Last Unicorn ! By Samantha Darko .
Donnie ! Give it back !
That 's not what I heard . Now they think I did it .
Well , if you 're innocent , then you have nothing to worry about .
Why did you make me flood the school ?
We just want to guide you in the right direction .
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit ?
Take it off . I want to see you .
How much longer is this gon na last ?
You should already know that . Watch the movie , Donnie . I have something to show you .
My dad said he found you on the golf course . Are you sleepwalking again ?
I do n't wan na talk about it .
What 'd you do , Donnie ? What 'd you do !
Go home . Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine .
Oh , I have those too . What kind of problems does your dad have ?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest .
Wow . Did he go to jail ?
He fled . They still ca n't find him . My mom and I had to change our names and stuff . I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool .
Do n't knock soap . Without it , disease would spread rapidly . If we ran out you and I would never live to see the year 2000 .
Wonder where we 'll be then .
That 's not good enough . You 've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them with whatever you wanted .
With , like , images ?
I always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be .
Yeah . And right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us .
Oh , yeah . The Philosophy of Time Travel . What is this ?
She wrote it . There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I 've been seeing . It ca n't just be a coincidence . Will you come see her with me ?
What ? How long was I asleep ?
The whole movie . Let 's go .
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge ?
What 's wrong with you ?
Time is running out . We have to go see Grandma Death . We have to talk to her .
Why ? Is this about the book ?
I 'm sorry , Ms. Farmer , I just do n't get this .
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline .
I just do n't get this . Everything ca n't be lumped into two categories . That 's too simple .
The Lifeline is divided that way .
Well , life is n't that simple . So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet ? That has nothing to do with either fear or love .
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions .
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn ? 'Cause that 's a great place to raise children .
No , a year of partying is enough . She 'll be going to Harvard this fall .
Oh , please tell me , Elizabeth , how exactly does one suck a fuck ?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table .
I wish I knew where you went at night . Did you toilet paper the Johnson 's house ?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade , Mom . Get out of my room .
You know it would be nice to look at you some time and see my son . I do n't recognise this person today .
Then why do n't you start taking the goddamn pills ?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow .
Do you get to meet Ed ?
Who 's been giving you weird looks ?
A lot of people . Teachers . Younger kids . It 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason . But that 's OK because I know I deserve it .
Because the rabbits are us , Donnie .
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human ?
That 's bullshit . You 're a good teacher .
Thank you , Donnie . And you 're a good student . Lazy but a good student . Unlike most of the others , you question Mom and Dad 's rules .
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you ?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine . It is up to the children to save themselves these days . Because the parents they do n't have a clue .
So will Donnie find his Cellar Door ?
I think I already have . But now she wo n't even talk to me .
Your mother said that you 've been skipping cycles of your medication .
I 've been taking it . I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this . You know , abuse her . Psychologically .
So , I met a new friend .
Would you like to talk about this friend ?
Frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened .
He said to follow him .
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end ?
No . That 's stupid .
What else do you think about during school ?
I think about Who 's the Boss ?
How many times have you seen Frank ?
Four times so far .
Who is they ? Is Frank part of some larger group ?
I do n't know . Gretchen has a theory . That Frank is a sign . I told her I thought it was ridiculous .
Yeah , but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see ?
So , your parents why did you disappoint them ?
I I was playing with fire .
They did n't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year .
What did you want for Christmas that year ?
Yes . I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert 's house . I think I only have a few days left before they catch me .
Why did you do these things , Donnie ? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes ?
It 's too late . I 've already ruined my life .
You will survive this Donald . I promise you that you will survive . You must let me help you . And when I clap my hands together , you will wake up .
It 's called The Philosophy of Time Travel .
What does time travel have to do with philosophy ?
No I do n't . She worries about you .
Well , do n't worry I 'm taking my medication .
It 's not that . I mean mouthing off to your teachers . I 'll admit when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer , I laughed my ass off .
I was just being honest .
Mom and Dad wo n't be back until Sunday night . It 's Halloween Carnival . We should throw a party . We could totally get away with it .
Okay , but it has to be a small one .
Thank you for seeing us We just felt that it was time to discuss
What I think is going on with your son .
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination .
You 're telling me my son has an imaginary friend ?
If that 's what you think is necessary .
But let me remind you that this treatment is experimental .
He was a year ahead of us ?
He died , remember ? On the way to the prom . He was doomed .
I did n't realise it was such a big deal .
It is a big deal .
Here are the keys to the Taurus . There 's plenty of groceries in the fridge . And I left money on the kitchen table . And do n't forget
Do n't worry , Mom . Just go , you 'll miss your flight .
Excuse me but what is the real issue here ? The PTA does n't ban books from school .
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school 's curriculum .
Do you even know who Graham Greene is ?
I think we 've all seen Bonanza .
And how do they do this ? They FLOOD the house by breaking through the water main !
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus .
You know , there 's , like , this rule . We get to go home at 7:55 .
All right ! 7:55 . Everybody goes home .
Let 's go to Donnie 's house . His parents are both at work .
We got eggs , water balloons , and a dozen rolls of toilet paper .
I stole four beers from my dad .
Oh , shut up . I thought it might help you get some sleep .
Loretta , never have kids .
I never liked her , but she did n't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that . The whole thing 's just kinda sad and lame at the same time .
This came for you , sweetie .
I got ta work with these women .
Okay , sweetie , that 's all right . Let 's go . Let 's go .
I just , I just ca n't believe it . I 'm Minnesota 's American Teen Princess !
Our baby 's going to Nationals ! Lincoln , Alabama look out !
I 'm gon na need more caps .
You hafta go home . There 's some kinda emergency at the trailer park .
Nice mouth you got there , Mom , but I I 'm not goin ' through this again .
You 're not goin ' through this again ? You ? You 're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels .
God I hope that 's you and not your concussion talkin ' .
It 's me I just do n't want this to be the thing you 'd do over . This pageant 's your ticket outta here . I know you can win , Amber .
Mrs. Clark , why are you doing this to me ? Why 're you pretendin ' you do n't know what 's goin ' on ?
Amber , I 'm sorry . I really am . But you know the rules . All talent costumes hafta be okay 'd by Gladys before the pageant .
This , this This is bullshit !
Amber Atkins ! That is not American Teen Princess language !
Here , I 'll take it . It 's my job .
NO It 's all right . I got it . Do n't worry about it .
What do you mean , they take out her butt ?
Oh , Jesus H. Christ !
It 's just the guys that are you know , makin ' the movie about the pageant . I told you about 'em .
Oh , naw . Hi .
Y'know , if you have , you got all the pictures of the winner you need .
Shut it up , Loretta .
She 's the prettiest , y'know . The best damn tapper . The most smartest
Most smartest ? Oh , that 's good , Loretta . Make sure you get a picture of that . Most smartest . We 're cuttin you off and sendin ' you home .
