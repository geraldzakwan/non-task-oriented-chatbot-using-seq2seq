Oh, thank you. I will take care of myself.

I would like to purchase some health insurance.
Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.
Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
Could you explain the difference between HMO and PPO?
To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor.
When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?
The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like.
How much will an HMO cost me per month?
Please go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote.
I am calling to purchase health insurance.
Do you have health insurance now?
I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.
You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
I don't know which I want, an HMO or a PPO.
Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors.
When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?
The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.
How much will a PPO cost me per month?
We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire.
I need information on purchasing health insurance.
Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
This is my first time buying health insurance.
You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?
I am not sure what HMO and PPO are.
Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?
By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?
We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.
Good morning, is this Papaya?
You are speaking with Papaya. How can I help you?
Papaya, this is Malia, and I need to call in sick today.
What seems to be the problem?
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak.
When did you get that?
I think I got it on Saturday, but it just showed up today.
What are you doing for it?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot.
Good. You probably should be much better by tomorrow.
May I speak to Papaya, please?
This is Papaya you are speaking with. What can I do for you?
Hi, Papaya, this is Malia, and I will not be coming to work today.
What is wrong with you?
I have really bad poison oak and can't stop itching.
How long have you had it?
I've had it a few days, but the rash really got bad last night.
How have you been treating it?
I have some lotion that the doctor gave me, as well as an antihistamine.
That should work. I'll see you tomorrow when you return to work.
I would like to speak with Papaya.
This is Papaya. How may I help you?
Papaya, this is Malia, and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather.
Do you know what the problem is?
I have a horrible rash from poison oak.
Have you had it a long time?
The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days.
Have you been using anything for it?
I bought some over-the-counter lotion, and I am taking an antihistamine.
That will probably take care of your symptoms. I'll see you tomorrow.
I have a doctor's appointment scheduled with Dr. Smith, and I need to change it.
What day did you have it scheduled for?
My appointment was on Tuesday.
What time was it scheduled for?
It was for two o'clock in the afternoon.
I see your appointment. What day would you like to switch to?
I would like to switch it to next Friday.
What time would you like?
I would like to come in at 10:00 in the morning.
Fine, I will pencil that in right now. We will see you then.
I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Smith, and I can't make it on that day.
What day was your appointment on?
My appointment was on Monday.
What time had you chosen?
It was for 10:00 in the morning.
I am looking at your appointment right now. What day would you prefer?
I would prefer next Thursday.
What time would be best for you?
I want to come in at 2:00 in the afternoon.
I am writing you down for that time. We look forward to seeing you.
Good morning, I made an appointment with Dr. Smith, but I have to change it.
When you made your appointment, what day did you choose?
My appointment was on Wednesday.
At what time was that appointment?
It was for 4:00 in the afternoon.
I can see the appointment that you had. What day do you need to change to?
I want to change to next Tuesday.
What time would you prefer?
I would prefer three o'clock in the afternoon.
I will put you down for that time. Thank you for calling to reschedule.
Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the emergency room.
Of course. What is the problem?
I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my stomach.
If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there if you fall asleep.
I can do that when I get off of the phone.
Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?
I already had them out before I called you.
Where is your nearest emergency room?
It's just a few blocks away.
Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.
I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me get to the emergency room?
We will come right over. What happened?
My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash!
Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall asleep before I get there.
I will do that in a minute, and make sure you can get in.
Also make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we can grab them.
I know right where they both are.
Is there an emergency room near you?
It is on the other side of town, next to city hall.
I am on my way. Give me ten minutes and I'll get to you.
I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the emergency room.
I will take you there right away. What is wrong?
I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105!
I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the back door right now, that would be great.
I will make sure that I do that before you get here.
Also, make sure that we have your driver's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room.
I am getting them out while I am speaking to you.
Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?
It is near the bridge that crosses over the river.
I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there!
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received.
Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
It was for my Master Card.
You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.
I haven't got it in the mail yet.
The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.
What am I supposed to do about my bill then?
Maybe you should call your post office.
But if it's their mistake, can I get an extension on my bill payment?
Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.
Thank you very much for your help.
No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.
I haven't received my credit card bill yet.
Which credit card are you speaking of?
My Master Card.
We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago.
I never got it.
Your bill was mailed already.
What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill?
If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.
Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault?
If that's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake.
Thanks for everything.
Don't mention it. Call back if you have any more problems.
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got.
Which credit card was the bill for?
The bill was for my Master Card.
That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago.
It never came in the mail.
My computer shows that it has already been mailed.
I have not gotten my bill, so what should I do about that?
You should try contacting your post office.
If it is the post office's fault, may I have an extension on my bill?
You'll have to prove it was their error; then you can get an extension.
Thank you for all your help.
You are very welcome. Have a good day.
There's a problem with my credit card.
Tell me what the problem is.
A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make.
What was the charge for?
The charge was for a $350 purse, but I did not buy it.
Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase?
I would know if I bought something that expensive.
I apologize. What day was this purchase made?
It was bought on November 12th at 3:15 pm, while I was at work.
All right, we'll do an investigation.
Until this investigation is finished, will I have to pay for the charge?
No, you don't. We'll take care of it.
I have a problem with my credit card.
What's wrong with it?
There is a charge on my card that I didn't make.
Can you tell me what the charge was?
It's for a purse that cost $350.
Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse?
I can't even afford a purse that expensive.
I'm very sorry. When was this purchase made?
I was at work, but the purchase was made at 3:15 on November 12th.
We're going to investigate this claim.
Do I have to pay for this charge?
You won't have to pay for anything.
There is something wrong with my credit card.
What's the problem?
There is a charge on here that I never made.
What charge was made?
It was a charge for a $350 purse that I never bought.
You didn't make this purchase?
I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large.
Sorry. When was this purse purchased?
It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3:15 pm, but I was at work.
We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, do I have to pay for this charge?
No. We'll take care of everything.
I would like to order cable.
Sure, what package do you want?
What kinds of packages do you offer?
We have all kinds of movie channel packages.
What else do you have?
There is a package for all sports channels.
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also?
Yes, we do offer that package.
I want that.
Do you want anything else?
No, but is it possible for me to add channels later?
You can always get rid of channels or add some later.
I want to get some cable.
Do you know what package you want to get?
What packages do you have?
We have movie channel packages.
What else have you got?
You can get the sports package.
Is there a package with basic and movie channels?
We have that package.
Let me get that package.
Is there anything else you would like?
That's everything, but can I add channels later?
You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day.
May I order some cable from you today?
Okay, what package would you like to order?
I'm not sure of what packages you offer.
We offer packages with all the movie channels.
Are there any other packages?
We also have packages with all the sports channels.
I want a package that has the basic and movie channels.
We have that available.
I would like to get that.
Would you like anything else with your package?
That's it, but will I be able to add more channels at another time?
Yes, you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like.
I would like to order some internet today.
What kind would you like?
What kind of internet is there?
You can get DSL or dial-up.
Which of those two is best?
I would recommend DSL.
Is that one better?
It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
What do you mean by that?
DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet?
That's correct. With DSL you can do both.
I need to get internet.
Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
What kind of internet can I get?
There is dial-up or DSL.
Which one do you feel is best?
I would get DSL if I were you.
DSL is better than dial-up?
It's the best choice; plus, it won't tie up your phone line.
I'm not sure what that means.
Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
That'll make it impossible for me to use.
Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.
I'd like to have internet for my computer.
Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
What are my options for the internet?
You can either get dial-up or DSL.
Which one would you recommend?
DSL is the best choice.
Why is DSL better?
It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
What exactly does that mean?
Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right?
That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.
I am calling about my cable service.
What's the problem?
For the past week my cable hasn't been working.
I apologize, but the cable has been down lately.
Do you know when it is going to start working again?
Give it a couple days, and it should be back on.
Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working?
Since it's not working, I'm going to give you a credit.
So I don't have to pay anything?
You won't pay anything until your service starts working again.
Okay, thank you very much for your help.
No problem. Thank you for being so understanding.
I have a question about my cable.
What do you need?
I haven't been able to use my cable service for the past week.
Right now the cable isn't working.
Could you tell me when the cable will be back on?
The cable should be running again in a couple of days.
In the meantime, do I still have to pay for the cable?
We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience.
Does that mean I won't have to pay for it?
It'll be free until it comes back on.
Thanks, I appreciate your help.
Thank you for all your patience.
I have a problem with my cable.
What about it?
My cable has been out for the past week or so.
The cable is down right now. I am very sorry.
When will it be working again?
It should be back on in the next couple of days.
Do I still have to pay for the cable?
We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down.
So, I don't have to pay for it?
No, not until your cable comes back on.
Thanks for everything.
You're welcome, and thank you for your understanding.
I need somebody to come over and fix my internet.
What's wrong with it?
For some reason it's just not connecting.
How long have you been having this problem?
It hasn't been working the past few days.
Does the internet come up at all?
It does, but it won't connect to anything.
Well, the internet isn't down, so there must be something wrong with your connection.
Could you send someone to fix it today?
I'll send somebody over right away to fix it.
When will they be here?
They should be there in the next hour.
I need to get my internet fixed.
What's the problem with your internet?
It won't connect.
How long has this been happening?
This connection problem has been happening for a few days now.
The internet doesn't come up at all?
It just won't connect to a webpage, but it will pop up.
There's obviously a problem with your connection.
I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me.
I can send somebody right now to fix it.
How long will it take for them to get here?
They'll be there in about an hour.
Can you send someone to fix my internet?
Are you having a problem with it?
My internet is having problems connecting.
Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up?
I've been having this problem for the last few days.
Will the internet even pop up?
It'll pop up, but it won't connect to a webpage.
Since the internet isn't broken, your connection must be messed up.
Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it?
If you'd like, I can send someone to fix it right now.
How long will it be till they get here?
It should be no longer than an hour.
I am interested in buying auto insurance.
Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
Yes, I brought everything with me.
Is your car with you?
Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
What else do I need to consider for the auto insurance?
Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well.
Good morning, I need to buy car insurance for the used car I just bought.
Yes, no problem. Do you have your registration and Certificate of Ownership with you?
Yes, it is all right here.
Did you drive your car here?
Yes, it is out in the back.
That's great. We'll go out and check the condition of your car.
I understand, what should I insure my car for?
There is a Blue Book price for your car and we will use that price.
What other things do I need to insure for?
We will factor in damage to the other car as well as property damage and injury.
I just bought a used car and need to insure it.
We can take care of that right now. Do you have all of your paperwork with you?
Yes, I took care of all of that and have the papers with me.
Did you bring your car with you?
Yes, it is parked on the street.
Fine, I need to go out with you to check your car for wear and tear.
Fine, how will I know how much I should insure my car for?
After looking at your car, I will use the Blue Book price and we will consider the condition of the car.
Are there other considerations when I insure my car?
We always need to think about property damage, damage to other vehicles, and injury.
What kind of car insurance do you have?
I went with the Automobile Club.
Why did you choose that company?
I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
What should I think about in choosing services?
There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
What did you end up buying for your auto insurance?
Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.
Have you ever had to use your insurance?
I never had to use my insurance.
When you insured your car, what kind did you buy?
I decided to buy from GEICO.
What influenced your choice of companies?
I looked at the customer satisfaction rating of the company.
How did you figure out what services to buy?
Every individual has different considerations. Your agent can help you understand what you need to think about.
What did you place an emphasis on when you bought your insurance?
I carry a lot of liability insurance because I own a house and need to protect it from a lawsuit.
Did you ever get into an accident and need your insurance?
I was in an accident and was happy that I had good insurance to cover it.
What car insurance company did you decide to go with when you bought your new car?
State Farm seemed like the best deal for me.
How did you make that decision?
I compared rates and services available.
Where can I get help in figuring out what I need to purchase for coverage?
You can pick up a pamphlet at your insurance company that will explain the options to you.
What did you decide to cover yourself for?
I pretty much carry the average amount in all categories as the agent recommended.
How many times have you actually used your insurance?
I was in an accident, but it was the other person's fault and their insurance covered it.
I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.
Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?
I already took care of that yesterday.
That's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?
Yes, I think we've agreed upon a fair price.
Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?
Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.
That's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive your car home?
That would be a great help!
Glad to be of help.
That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.
From what I see, it's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?
A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.
It's good that you took care of that. Have you agreed upon a price with the seller?
Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that.
Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?
Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union.
You are very well prepared! I could go with you to talk to the seller and help you get your car home.
I appreciate the offer of help!
It would be my pleasure to help you.
I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.
It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take a look at it just to be sure.
My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.
That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a price?
Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.
Have you thought about how to pay for your car?
I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.
You've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment and drive your car home for you.
That would make it a lot easier for me.
I am glad that can help. Let's go take care of that right now.
I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?
I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
How long have you been in your current home?
I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.
What is the next step in selling my home?
I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.
I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When were you thinking of selling your home?
I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own.
Have you owned your home for a long time?
I just bought my home two years ago.
I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract.
I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.
It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you interested in selling in the near future?
I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii.
Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away.
Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.
Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?
It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
What should we be doing to get the process started?
If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.
Thank you for coming to look at my house.
I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.
When will people come to look at my house?
Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.
Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office?
Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
Will I know when people are going to come see my house?
We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
What happens during an Open House day?
You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the details.
I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.
It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.
How do you show my home to potential buyers?
We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.
Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?
We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
How will I know when to expect prospective house buyers?
That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours notice.
Can I stay home during an Open House day?
The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle the showing of your home.
Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.
I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.
When can people come and see my home?
We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show your house during the week.
Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers?
Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.
Can people just drop in anytime they feel like the house?
We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.
Will I have to go away during an Open House day?
I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else!
How much do you think that I should ask for my house?
Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
What do you look at when setting an asking price for the house?
We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?
Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?
The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth.
Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home?
You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?
You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?
We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.
What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
What is involved in figuring out an asking price?
We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?
You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.
Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers?
If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it.
I am interested in buying a house and need some information.
Yes, of course. What area are you interested in?
I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia.
What size house would you like?
We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
Are you interested in being in a particular school district?
Yes, we want to stay in the ABC School District.
Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view?
I would love to have a home with a view.
Fine, I will begin a search for the perfect home for you. I will call you in a few days.
I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you.
I can help you. What location are you looking for?
I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia.
Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size?
We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.
Is living in a particular school district important to you?
No, we don't really care because they are all pretty good around here.
Are you interested in purchasing on the lake, or would you like a home with a view?
We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat.
Now that I have an idea of what you want, I can begin my search.
I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.
I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house?
I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions.
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home.
Do you need to be located in a particular school district?
It doesn't matter, as we do not have any children.
Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?
In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.
Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.
I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?
My name is John Sandals.
Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days do you need that reservation, sir?
I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17.
Our room rates recently went up. Is that okay with you, sir?
How much per night are we talking about?
Each night will be $308.
That price is perfectly acceptable.
Wonderful! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room?
Nonsmoking, please.
Next question: Is a queen-size bed okay?
Queen-size sounds fine to me.
Okay, sir. Your reservation is in our computer. All we need now is a phone number.
Certainly. My phone number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you, sir. We look forward to seeing you here!
Hi there, I want to reserve a hotel room.
No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please?
Sure, My name is John Sandals.
Hi, Mr. Sandals. I'm Papaya, at your service. When do you need the room?
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th.
We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
It's $308 a night.
I have no problem with that.
Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Definitely nonsmoking. I can't handle that smell.
Nonsmoking. Now, is a queen-size bed okay?
No problem. Queen-size sounds good to me.
Great, sir. Your reservation is confirmed. Now all I need is your phone number.
Of course! The phone number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you so much, sir. We look forward to seeing you!
I need to reserve a room.
Not a problem. May I have your name, please?

Hi, sir. My name is Papaya. Could you tell me when you need the room?
Right now. I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th.
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates. Do you find that acceptable, sir?
Maybe. How much is a room?
The price per night is $308.
That sounds fine to me.
Fantastic! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?
I hate cigarettes! Nonsmoking.
That'll be nonsmoking. Now, do you approve of a single queen-size bed?
That'll be no problem.
I'm happy to hear that, sir. Your reservation is all set except for your phone number.
Sure! My number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you for doing business with us, and we look forward to seeing you!
I need a hotel room.
That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please?
Certainly. My name is John Sandals.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days will you need a room?
Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17.
One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that acceptable, sir?
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
It'll be $308 nightly.
That's a reasonable price.
Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking.
I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay?
A queen sounds great.
Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me your phone number.
That would be 305-555-1788.
Ok, I got it. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!
I need a room for a few days.
That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name?
My name is John Sandals.
Sir, I'm Papaya, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be here.
I'll be there in April: Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th.
We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price?
The price will be $308 a night.
That price is not bad for me.
Very good. Now sir, about the room, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, definitely!
Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay?
Yes, that'll be just fine.
One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is your phone number.
It's 305-555-1788.
Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
Can I reserve a hotel room?
I assure you, that's not a problem. What is your full name, please?
My name's John Sandals.
It's a pleasure to assist you. Please tell me when you'll be needing the room, sir.
If my plans don't change, I'll need a room April 14 till April 17.
Sir, our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will that be okay?
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
$308 a night? That's a fair price.
Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, please.
Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?
I have absolutely no problem with that.
Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just give me your phone number.
Not a problem. The number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you for making a reservation with us. We look forward to seeing you!
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.
Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What is this blood test for?
Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.
What does the blood test result tell him?
Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.
Will the blood test hurt?
It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up.
Ouch!
There we go! I got the blood that I needed.
My doctor says that I need a blood test.
I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What are you taking my blood for?
Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count.
What information does the blood test give him?
If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection somewhere in your body.
Is a blood test painful?
I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein. It will only feel like a little pin prick.
My God, that hurts!
That was it! Thank you for coming in today.
I came to this lab to have my blood drawn.
You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat.
What am I being tested for?
Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is.
What does my white blood cell count tell him?
Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection.
How much will the blood test hurt?
It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find.
Is that my blood going into that tube?
That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for coming in!
I need to make an appointment to see the doctor.

Good morning, how are you doing today?
I have been feeling pretty good.
So, I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical.
Yes, I am playing on the tennis team this year, and they are requiring me to get a physical exam.
We are basically going to check your heart, lungs, blood sugar levels, and eyes, ears, and nose.
I've kind of been having problems being out of breath. Can you look at that?
Yes, I will check you for asthma, and maybe we can check you for allergies later.
Thank you. What will the blood test tell you?
We will be checking for blood sugar, cholesterol, and white blood cell count.
I have been working hard to stay healthy. I hope the tests turn out well.
So how are we feeling today?
Things are going well for me.
Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical?
Yes, I am applying for new health insurance, and I need a physical examination to qualify.
Your basic physical exam will include lungs, heart, blood levels, and eyes, ears, and nose.
I've been having a little trouble breathing. Would you look into that, please?
We can do an allergy test, and later I can send you for an asthma test.
I would appreciate it. When you give me a blood test, what are you looking for?
I am going to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and white blood cell count.
I am expecting the tests to go well. I have been taking good care of myself.
Nice to see you. How have you been feeling lately?
I have been feeling great.
I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical.
Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems.
We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should be.
I've been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that?
I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion.
That would be great. What is the blood test for?
The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar.
I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly.

No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
Sure, what can I help you with?
What kind of public transportation is near your apartment?
I'm not sure, but I believe there is a bus stop about three blocks away.
Do you know what direction that bus travels?
I'm sorry. If you check online, you can get that kind of information.
Okay, I'll just go online.
Okay. Good luck with your search.
Hello, I was hoping you could give me more info about your apartment.
I can try to help you. What would you like to know?
Is there access to public transportation near the apartment?
I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop within walking distance.

I think the local library has bus info.
Good luck. The bus info shouldn't be too hard to find.
Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
All right, what do you need to know?
What is the public transportation like near your apartment?
I don't use buses, but I think there's a bus stop a few blocks away.

I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about the bus system.
I'll just check my phone book. It has lots of good information.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you on that.
I was hoping you could give me more information about the apartment for rent.
I can certainly try.
Do buses or trains run by the apartment?
I can't swear to it, but I think a bus stop is a couple of blocks away.
Where does the bus take you?
I don't want to lead you astray. You should check online.
My neighbor takes the bus. I'll ask him if he knows.
Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.
Could you give me a little more information about the apartment?
Sure, if I can. What do you want to know?
Is there a bus or train system near the apartment?
I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop only a few blocks away.
Do you know which buses stop there?
I'm sure there's an 800 number or a website that could help you.
I don't have a computer. I'll just look in my phone book.
Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.
How did you find your apartment?
You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing.
What if I need a roommate?
There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate.
How much do apartments cost around here?
It depends on what you want. Do you want a one or two-bedroom apartment?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment.
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month.
Would you come with me to look at apartments?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you.

You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month.
I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me.
Sure, I'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want.
How are you doing today?
Great. Thanks for asking.
Would you like our assistance with a move?
Yes, actually I would.
What would you like us to move for you?
I need you to move my furniture.
Could you tell me what kind of residence that we will be picking the furniture up from?
The furniture is in my apartment.
Where will we be moving it to?
You'll be taking it to the house I just bought.
All right. I just need both addresses, and we will take care of the moving for you.
Excellent. Thank you very much.

I am doing well.
Did you need us to move something for you?
That's exactly what I'm calling about.

All my furniture needs to be moved.
Where will we be moving your furniture from?
I need it moved from my apartment.
Where would you like us to move the furniture to?
I need the furniture moved to my new house.
