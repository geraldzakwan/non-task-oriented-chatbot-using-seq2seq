I will explain it again ; especially for those of you who arrived late .
I lost track of time , am I late ?
Yes . What kept you from arriving on time ?
My friend needed me to help him .
I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on .
My apologies . I will make up the time .
I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting .
Sure , I 'll sit right here .
Wonderful , does anyone have any questions about this project ?
I am confused about the projected revenues .
I 'm glad that some of you get it , but let 's go over it once more .
Are you going to vote ?
Yes , are you ?
Yes , but what day are the elections ?
You do n't know what day the elections are ?
That 's why I 'm asking you .
They 're this coming Tuesday .
Really ?
Yes , I 'm serious .
Good thing you told me .
I ca n't believe you did n't know that .
It slipped my mind .
You should watch the news more often .
Will you be voting ?
I will . Will you be voting ?
When is the election ?
You do n't know that ?
I just do n't know when .
It 's this Tuesday .
You ca n't be serious .
Why would I joke ?
Thanks for telling me .
You should 've known already .
I forgot the time for voting .
As long as you go vote , that 's all that matters .
Are you going to vote ?
Of course ! Are you ?
I plan to , but what day is the election ?
You should know that .
Can you just tell me about the election time ?
Yes , the election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I 'm not kidding .
It 's a good thing I asked you .
That should 've been something you knew already .
I could n't remember the date for voting .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
Will you be voting this year ?
Of course ! Will you ?
This is going to be my first time voting .
Are you serious ?
I 'm not sure what I 'm doing .
Voting is easy .
I do n't know anything about the bills or laws they 're trying to pass .
The ballot gives you all that information .
Nobody told me that before .
You have nothing to worry about .
I 'm so glad you told me that .
Good luck on your first election .
Do you plan on voting this Tuesday ?
Yes . What about you ?
I already voted .
What do you mean you already voted ?
I had to mail in an absentee ballot .
Why 'd you have to do that ?
I 'm not going to be able to vote this Tuesday .
Why did you vote beforehand ?
I have to work this Tuesday .
You can always go to work late .
That same morning I have some business to take care of .
Oh , I understand .
What are you collecting donations for ?
We 're trying to raise money for the campaigns .

As much as possible .

We 're getting donations for the campaigns .
How much money are you looking to make ?
As much as we can .
Are you doing different fundraisers ?
We 're just going door to door .
You should do something else .
Do you have any suggestions ?
Try a car wash and selling candy .
That is a good idea .
Donations for what ?
It 's for the campaigns .
How much money are you trying to raise ?
It does n't matter how much .
What are you doing to raise money ?
We go door to door asking for donations .
You should try other fundraisers .
Like what ?
You can always wash cars and sell candy .
That 's a great idea .
It 's very nice to meet you .
Nice meeting you , too .
I ca n't believe I 'm actually speaking to a candidate .
You can ask me questions , if you 'd like .
I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage .
Everyone should be able to love who they want .
Would you make gay marriage legal ?
I sure would .
I know a lot of people would n't agree with that .
That 's not my problem .
I think that is really cool of you .
I 'm glad to hear that .
Nice to meet you .
It 's very nice meeting you , too .
I 'm excited to speak to a candidate .
What would you like to ask me ?
What is your stand on gay marriage ?
I feel that people can love who they want .
So , would you make gay marriage legal ?
Of course !
I 'm sure plenty of people wo n't like that .
I ca n't help that .
I like that .
I hope so .
It 's nice meeting you .
It 's nice to meet you , too .
I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
Would you like to ask me anything ?
What do you feel about gay marriage ?
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people wo n't like that .
I 'm sure they wo n't , but that 's my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
I would like to purchase some health insurance .
Have you ever purchased health insurance before ?
I have health insurance now , but I want to look into other choices .
Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO ?
Could you explain the difference between HMO and PPO ?
To clarify it for you , with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor .
When I pay for a service , is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO ?
The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO , but you can go anywhere you like .
How much will an HMO cost me per month ?
Please go to our website and fill in the questionnaire . Once we have all of your information , we can give you a quote .
I am calling to purchase health insurance .
Do you have health insurance now ?
I was on my parents ' policy , but I need to start buying my own .
You can purchase an HMO or a PPO . Do you know what you want ?
I do n't know which I want , an HMO or a PPO .
Let me explain it to you . An HMO is a little cheaper , but you can only choose certain doctors .
When I go to the doctor , do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO ?
The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors .
How much will a PPO cost me per month ?
We need to factor in many things . Why do n't you come in , and we will have you fill out a questionnaire .
I need information on purchasing health insurance .
Is this the first time you have had health insurance ?
This is my first time buying health insurance .
You have a choice of HMO or PPO . Do you understand the difference ?
I am not sure what HMO and PPO are .
Just so you understand completely : An HMO is a little cheaper , but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose .
If I need to use my insurance , are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO ?
By going to the providers on the HMO list , you save money in out-of-pocket expenses .
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO ?
We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information , we will mail you a quote .
Good morning , is this Papaya ?
You are speaking with Papaya . How can I help you ?
Papaya , this is Malia , and I need to call in sick today .
What seems to be the problem ?
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak .
When did you get that ?
I think I got it on Saturday , but it just showed up today .
What are you doing for it ?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot .
Good . You probably should be much better by tomorrow .
May I speak to Papaya , please ?
This is Papaya you are speaking with . What can I do for you ?
Hi , Papaya , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today .
What is wrong with you ?
I have really bad poison oak and ca n't stop itching .
How long have you had it ?
I 've had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night .
How have you been treating it ?
I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine .
That should work . I 'll see you tomorrow when you return to work .
I would like to speak with Papaya .
This is Papaya . How may I help you ?
Papaya , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather .
Do you know what the problem is ?
I have a horrible rash from poison oak .
Have you had it a long time ?
The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days .
Have you been using anything for it ?
I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine .
That will probably take care of your symptoms . I 'll see you tomorrow .
I have a doctor 's appointment scheduled with Dr. Smith , and I need to change it .

I would prefer three o'clock in the afternoon .
I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
Sorry to bother you , but I was wondering if you could drive me to the emergency room .
Of course . What is the problem ?
I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees , and I have a rash on my stomach .
If you can , go and unlock the back door , so I can get in when I get there if you fall asleep .
I can do that when I get off of the phone .
Do you know where your driver 's license and insurance card are ?
I already had them out before I called you .
Where is your nearest emergency room ?
It 's just a few blocks away .
Fine , I am on my way . I 'll be there in about five minutes .
I hate to call you this late at night , but could you possibly help me get to the emergency room ?
We will come right over . What happened ?
My temperature went up to 105 , and I have a rash !
Make sure that someone unlocks the back door , so I can get in if you fall asleep before I get there .
I will do that in a minute , and make sure you can get in .
Also make sure that you have your insurance card and driver 's license where we can grab them .
I know right where they both are .
Is there an emergency room near you ?
It is on the other side of town , next to city hall .
I am on my way . Give me ten minutes and I 'll get to you .
I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the emergency room .
I will take you there right away . What is wrong ?
I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105 !
I want to be able to get to you when I get there . If you can unlock the back door right now , that would be great .
I will make sure that I do that before you get here .
Also , make sure that we have your driver 's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room .
I am getting them out while I am speaking to you .
Do you know where your nearest emergency room is ?
It is near the bridge that crosses over the river .
I am driving to you even as we speak . Hang in there !
I 'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
It was for my Master Card .
You should 've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
I have n't got it in the mail yet .
The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
Maybe you should call your post office .
But if it 's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
Thank you very much for your help .
No problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
I have n't received my credit card bill yet .
Which credit card are you speaking of ?
My Master Card .
We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago .
I never got it .
Your bill was mailed already .
What am I going to do since I have n't received the bill ?
If you have n't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office .
Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office 's fault ?
If that 's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake .
Thanks for everything .
Do n't mention it . Call back if you have any more problems .
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got .
Which credit card was the bill for ?
The bill was for my Master Card .
That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago .
It never came in the mail .
My computer shows that it has already been mailed .
I have not gotten my bill , so what should I do about that ?
You should try contacting your post office .
If it is the post office 's fault , may I have an extension on my bill ?
You 'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension .
Thank you for all your help .
You are very welcome . Have a good day .
There 's a problem with my credit card .
Tell me what the problem is .
A charge came up on my bill that I did n't make .
What was the charge for ?
The charge was for a $ 350 purse , but I did not buy it .
Are you sure that you did n't make that purchase ?
I would know if I bought something that expensive .
I apologize . What day was this purchase made ?
It was bought on November 12th at 3:15 pm , while I was at work .
All right , we 'll do an investigation .
Until this investigation is finished , will I have to pay for the charge ?
No , you do n't . We 'll take care of it .
I have a problem with my credit card .
What 's wrong with it ?
There is a charge on my card that I did n't make .
Can you tell me what the charge was ?
It 's for a purse that cost $ 350 .
Are you positive that you did n't buy the purse ?
I ca n't even afford a purse that expensive .
I 'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ?
I was at work , but the purchase was made at 3:15 on November 12th .
We 're going to investigate this claim .
Do I have to pay for this charge ?
You wo n't have to pay for anything .
There is something wrong with my credit card .
What 's the problem ?
There is a charge on here that I never made .
What charge was made ?
It was a charge for a $ 350 purse that I never bought .
You did n't make this purchase ?
I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large .
Sorry . When was this purse purchased ?
It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3:15 pm , but I was at work .
We 'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this .
In the meantime , do I have to pay for this charge ?
No . We 'll take care of everything .
I would like to order cable .
Sure , what package do you want ?
What kinds of packages do you offer ?
We have all kinds of movie channel packages .
What else do you have ?
There is a package for all sports channels .
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also ?
Yes , we do offer that package .
I want that .
Do you want anything else ?
No , but is it possible for me to add channels later ?
You can always get rid of channels or add some later .
I want to get some cable .
Do you know what package you want to get ?
What packages do you have ?
We have movie channel packages .
What else have you got ?
You can get the sports package .
Is there a package with basic and movie channels ?
We have that package .
Let me get that package .
Is there anything else you would like ?
That 's everything , but can I add channels later ?
You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day .
May I order some cable from you today ?
Okay , what package would you like to order ?
I 'm not sure of what packages you offer .
We offer packages with all the movie channels .
Are there any other packages ?
We also have packages with all the sports channels .
I want a package that has the basic and movie channels .
We have that available .
I would like to get that .
Would you like anything else with your package ?
That 's it , but will I be able to add more channels at another time ?
Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like .
I would like to order some internet today .
What kind would you like ?
What kind of internet is there ?
You can get DSL or dial-up .
Which of those two is best ?
I would recommend DSL .
Is that one better ?
It 's better because it does n't tie up your phone .
What do you mean by that ?
DSL is n't connected through your phone line , but dial-up is .
So then I ca n't use my phone if I 'm on the internet ?
That 's correct . With DSL you can do both .
I need to get internet .
Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ?
What kind of internet can I get ?
There is dial-up or DSL .
Which one do you feel is best ?
I would get DSL if I were you .
DSL is better than dial-up ?
It 's the best choice ; plus , it wo n't tie up your phone line .
I 'm not sure what that means .
Dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike DSL .
That 'll make it impossible for me to use .
Exactly . With DSL you do n't have that problem .
I 'd like to have internet for my computer .
Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ?
What are my options for the internet ?
You can either get dial-up or DSL .
Which one would you recommend ?
DSL is the best choice .
Why is DSL better ?
It 's a lot better because it does n't tie up your phone line .
What exactly does that mean ?
Well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line .
That means that I ca n't use my phone and the internet at the same time , right ?
That 's right . You wo n't have that problem with DSL .
I am calling about my cable service .
What 's the problem ?
For the past week my cable has n't been working .
I apologize , but the cable has been down lately .
Do you know when it is going to start working again ?
Give it a couple days , and it should be back on .
Will I still have to pay for the cable while it 's not working ?
Since it 's not working , I 'm going to give you a credit .
So I do n't have to pay anything ?
You wo n't pay anything until your service starts working again .
Okay , thank you very much for your help .
No problem . Thank you for being so understanding .
I have a question about my cable .
What do you need ?
I have n't been able to use my cable service for the past week .
Right now the cable is n't working .
Could you tell me when the cable will be back on ?
The cable should be running again in a couple of days .
In the meantime , do I still have to pay for the cable ?
We 'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience .
Does that mean I wo n't have to pay for it ?
It 'll be free until it comes back on .
Thanks , I appreciate your help .
Thank you for all your patience .
I have a problem with my cable .
What about it ?
My cable has been out for the past week or so .
The cable is down right now . I am very sorry .
Hey , uh , do n't go freaking out on me over this , but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera ?
Well I remember he had one but he , like , put it away after the first day . Why would that freak me out ?
Oh my God , that was good . Where 'd you learn all those new tricks ?
So it did n't feel weird ?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect ? Like , looking back , whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away ?
As if my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you . What 's he gon na do to me ?
I do n't know what to say . It 's beautiful .
Go on . Sit down .
Why are you doing all this for me ?
Simple math . When I woke up this morning and saw your smile I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you .
Please , Evan . Do n't even joke . He would n't hurt you . He 's just trying to scare you away from me .
Yeah , right . Tell that to Crockett .
I ca n't put my finger on it , but everything 's a bit off . Even the dinner tonight . It was beautiful , but
I know I 've been actin strange lately . It 's just that I do n't want anything to happen to us .
Oh , I thought you were my eight o'clock . Make it fast , I 'm expecting someone .
Nice to see you , too . Can I come in ?
So how 's tricks ? Sorry , occupational humor .
I get it . You can drop it now .
Oh , I 'm sorry . Does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ?
No . Just that you need to hurt me with it . I 've been where you 've been .
On the bridge . How did you know that Tommy had your dog ? That was no fucking hunch .
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts ?
You 're right , Evan , I do n't believe you .
I never thought you would . That 's why I 've never bothered to tell a soul until now , and why I never will again .
Sure you do n't want your wallet ?
Do n't think I 'll need it where I 'm going .
Kayleigh ? Do you ever think about us ? I mean , wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us ?
Sure , Evan , why not ? You were the first person I really ever cared about .
I never knew that . So then you still sometimes think of us together ?
It 's crossed my mind from time to time .
Then you think it might have worked out ?
Why not ? But that 's not how things wound up . I 'm with Lenny , Lenny 's your friend . And there it ends .
We 're really gon na be in a movie ! ?
That 's right , Evan , and you get to be the star .
Where am I ? What happened ? Where did we all go ?
Calm down , kid . Stand still .
That 's dangerous ! You could blow your hands off !
Been there , done that .
It 's okay . I wo n't bite . You 've seen pictures of me , right ?
Uh-huh . Mom says I have your eyes and your
Are you okay ? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there .
Look , Jason , I need some fast answers if I 'm ever gon na fix what I 've done .
I was praying this curse would have ended with me .
But it did n't . And now I need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me .
There is no right . When you change who people are , you destroy who they were .
Who 's to say you ca n't make things better ?
You ca n't play God , son . It must end with me . Just by being here , you may be killing your mother .
Bullshit . I 'll send you a postcard when I 've made everything perfect again .
Evan , you 're hysterical . You study for this ?
We 'll find out soon enough .
Thanks . Wow . Hey , I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow . If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers
I 'd say blow me . Get the pledges to do it .
Just do n't drop the ball , okay ?
I wo n't let you down , Professor Carter .
Remember , everyone ! Only two weeks until your science projects are due .
I still owe you an essay from last week . Is there any way I could get an extension ?
Most guys tuck their porn under here , but all you have are comp books .
Yeah . I 've been keeping journals since I was seven .
It did n't feel like a dream .
Maybe because they never do . So Don Juan , you pass out on all your dates ?
Can can Can I have this ?
Sure . I was gon na make a new one , anyway .
You knew the whole time , did n't you ? When you put the blade in my hand , you knew something big was going to happen . Did n't you ? !
Y yes . I guess I did .
Uh , we should be getting to class now .
Forget it . What 's the point of Psych now ? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh .
Are you sure you even packed it ?
My mom packed for me . I think she sent everything I ever owned . So we 'll see .
What do you need it for ? I do n't get you lately .
Duly noted . Now I 'm gon na ask you for one last favor .
Hey , what 'd you do that for ?
Fat little baby , crying for mommy .
Tommy , I 'm bored shitless over here . What 's up already ?
Hold your horses , man . It 's here somewhere . I saw it when I was a kid .
Hurry ! Let 's go ! Get him up , Evan ! Come on !
What happened ? Where are we ? !
Mom . Do n't cry . I can change this .
I think I 'll go check out the chapel .
Nothing . Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that .
I come from a big family .
Evan , guess what ? Dad got a new video camera and we 're all gon na be in a movie .
I do n't think Evan gets to be in it
Quit it , Tommy . Evan gets to be Robin Hood . I 'm gon na be Maid Marian , and you 're the Sheriff of Nottingham !
I thought I was the bad guy !
What did I say about mentioning that bitch ?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway ? Just blow something up already .
The hell you are n't . Anyone of us does it , you 'll puss out and narc for sure .
Ai n't gon na work this time , buddy . Look how small that fuse is ! I 'll get killed .
Maybe it went out . Should someone check it ?
Yeah , you do that , Lenny .
How did you get in here ? You 're under age .
I came with Captain Renault .
Monsieur Rick , what kind of man is Captain Renault ?
Oh , he 's just like any other man , only more so .
You will find a market there for this ring . I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice .
Thank you , but I hardly think
Such a bargain . But that is your decision ?
I 'm sorry . It is .
I recognize you from the news photographs , Monsieur Laszlo .
In a concentration camp , one is apt to lose a little weight .
We read five times that you were killed in five different places .
As you see , it was true every single time . Thank heaven I found you , Berger . I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte . He is supposed to help me .
Well , you are in pretty good shape , Herr Rick .
How long can I afford to stay closed ?
Oh , two weeks , maybe three .
Maybe I wo n't have to . A bribe has worked before . In the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
Now you finish locking up , will you , Carl ?
I will . Then I am going to the meeting of the
The police break up our meeting . Herr Rick ! We escaped in the last moment .
Come up here a minute .
Excuse me , Monsieur Rick , but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs . The cashier would like some money .
Well , I 'll get it from the safe .
Fine , but I would like to buy your cafe .
It 's not for sale .
That 's too bad . That 's Casablanca 's leading commodity . In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market .
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
I see the bus is in . I 'll take my shipment with me .
No hurry . I 'll have it sent over . Have a drink with me .
I never drink in the morning . And every time you send my shipment over , it 's always just a little bit short .
Carrying charges , my boy , carrying charges . Here , sit down . There 's something I want to talk over with you , anyhow .
The bourbon . The news about Ugarte upset me very much .
You 're a fat hypocrite . You do n't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do .
If I could lay my hands on those letters , I could make a fortune .
So could I . And I 'm a poor businessman .
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters .
I 'll tell him when he comes in .
Rick , I 'll put my cards on the table . I think you know where those letters are .
Well , you 're in good company . Renault and Strasser probably think so , too .
Shall we draw up the papers , or is our handshake good enough ?
It 's certainly not good enough . But since I 'm in a hurry , it 'll have to do .
Ah , to get out of Casablanca and go to America ! You 're a lucky man .
Oh , by the way , my agreement with Sam 's always been that he gets twenty-five percent of the profits . That still goes .
Do n't forget , you owe Rick 's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes .
I shall remember to pay it to myself .
We 've decided , Signor Ferrari . For the present we 'll go on looking for two exit visas . Thank you very much .
Well , good luck . But be careful . You know you 're being shadowed ?
Mademoiselle , after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca .
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca .
Uh huh . Under a safe conduct from me .
What value is that ? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past .
I remember every detail . The Germans wore gray , you wore blue .
Yes . I put that dress away . When the Germans march out , I 'll wear it again .
There 's still nobody in the world who can play As Time Goes By like Sam .
He has n't played it in a long time .
Who are you really ? And what were you before ? What did you do and what did you think ? Huh ?
We said no questions .
That 's easy . There was . He 's dead .
I 'm sorry for asking . I forgot we said no questions .
Richard , they 'll find out your record . It wo n't be safe for you here .
I 'm on their blacklist already , their roll of honor .
With the whole world crumbling , we pick this time to fall in love .
Yeah . It 's pretty bad timing . Where were you , say , ten years ago ?
Strange . I know so very little about you .
I know very little about you , just the fact that you had your teeth straightened .
But be serious , darling . You are in danger and you must leave Paris .
No , no , no , no . We must leave .
No , no . Not at my hotel . I , uh , I have things to do in the city before I leave . I 'll meet you at the station , huh ?
All right . At a quarter to five . Say , why do n't we get married in Marseilles ?
That 's too far ahead to plan .
Yes , I guess it is a little too far ahead . Well , let 's see . What about the engineer ? Why ca n't he marry us on the train ?
Oh . I saved my first drink to have with you . Here .
No . No , Rick . Not tonight .
Please do n't . Do n't , Rick . I can understand how you feel .
Huh ! You understand how I feel . How long was it we had , honey ?
Can I tell you a story , Rick ?
Has it got a wow finish ?
I do n't know the finish yet .
Well , go on , tell it . Maybe one will come to you as you go along .
Well , you can tell me now . I 'm reasonably sober .
I do n't think I will , Rick .
Did you run out on me because you could n't take it ? Because you knew what it would be like , hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
You can believe that if you want to .
All the same , someday you 'll lie to Laszlo . You 'll be there .
No , Rick . No , you see , Victor Laszlo is my husband and was , even when I knew you in Paris .
I told you this morning you 'd come around , but this is a little ahead of schedule . Well , wo n't you sit down ?
Richard , I had to see you .
Your unexpected visit is n't connected by any chance with the letters of transit ? It seems that as long as I have those letters I 'll never be lonely .
You can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
I went through all that with your husband . It 's no deal .
I know how you feel about me , but I 'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? What an important cause he 's fighting for ?
It was your cause , too . In your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
For the last time , put them on the table .
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you wo n't stop at anything . All right , I 'll make it easier for you .
But it 's all right , is n't it ? You were able to arrange everything ?
Everything is quite all right .
I do n't understand . What about you ?
I 'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away .
We 'll always have Paris . We did n't have , we 'd lost it , until you came to Casablanca . We got it back last night .
And I said I would never leave you .
You used to be a much better liar , Sam .
Leave him alone , Miss Ilsa . You 're bad luck to him .
Play it once , Sam , for old time 's sake .
I do n't know what you mean , Miss Ilsa .
Play it , Sam . Play As Time Goes By .
Oh I ca n't remember it , Miss Ilsa . I 'm a little rusty on it .
Victor , I , I feel somehow we should n't stay here .
If we would walk out so soon , it would only call attention to us . Perhaps Ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe .
This time they really mean to stop me .
Victor , I 'm afraid for you .
We are only interested in two visas , Signor .
Please , Ilsa , do n't be hasty .
No , Ilsa , I wo n't let you stay here . You must get to America . And believe me , somehow I will get out and join you .
But , Victor , if the situation were different , if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one , would you take it ?
He does . Could we have a table close to him ?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible .
Do n't joke . After Major Strasser 's warning tonight , I am frightened .
To tell you the truth , I am frightened too . Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall I carry on the best I can ?
Whatever I 'd say , you 'd carry on . Victor , why do n't you tell me about Rick ? What did you find out ?
Apparently he has the letters .
No , Victor , there is n't .
I love you very much , my dear .
I ca n't get over you two . She was asking about you earlier , Rick , in a way that made me extremely jealous .
I was n't sure you were the same . Let 's see , the last time we met
I 'm afraid Major Strasser would insist .
You 're saying this only to make me go .
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca .
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere .
Is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?
Yes . I found that a very expensive hobby , too . But then I never was much of a businessman .
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs ?
I appreciate it , but I do n't accept it .
I 'll raise it to two hundred thousand .
My friend , you could make it a million francs , or three , my answer would still be the same .
There must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them .
There is . I suggest that you ask your wife .
Do n't you sometimes wonder if it 's worth all this ? I mean what you 're fighting for ?
We might as well question why we breathe . If we stop breathing , we 'll die . If we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
I wonder if you do . I wonder if you know that you 're trying to escape from yourself and that you 'll never succeed .
You seem to know all about my destiny .
Monsieur Blaine , I do n't know how to thank you .
Oh , save it . We 've still lots of things to do .
I brought the money , Monsieur Blaine .
Keep it . You 'll need it in America .
Monsieur Blaine , I do n't ask you to explain anything .
I 'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . You said you knew about Ilsa and me .
I am Captain Renault , Prefect of Police .
Yes . What is it you want ?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor .
Thank you . I hope you 'll forgive me , Captain , but the present French administration has not always been so cordial . May I present Miss Ilsa Lund ?
Well ! A precedent is being broken . Er , Emil !
This is a very interesting cafe . I congratulate you .
Ricky , you 're becoming quite human . I suppose we have to thank you for that , Mademoiselle .
Ilsa , I do n't wish to be the one to say it , but it 's late .
That 's strange . Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca .
May we proceed with the business ?
I am afraid not . My regrets , Monsieur .
Well , perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca .
And the honor of having served the Third Reich .
I was in a German concentration camp for a year . That 's honor enough for a lifetime .
I believe you have a message for him ?
Nothing important , but may I speak to him now ?
I am making out the report now . We have n't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape .
Are you quite finished with us ?
I 'm sure you 'll excuse me if I am not gracious , but you see , Major Strasser , I 'm a Czechoslovakian .
You were a Czechoslovakian . Now you are a subject of the German Reich !
This is hardly the time or the place .
Then we shall state another time and another place . Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect 's office , with Mademoiselle .
Is that all you wish to tell us ?
Do n't be in such a hurry . You have all the time in the world . You may be in Casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow , on one condition .
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm , Major .
Oh , we Germans must get used to all climates , from Russia to the Sahara . But perhaps you were not referring to the weather .
Oh , there is no hurry . Tonight he 'll be at Rick 's . Everybody comes to Rick 's .
I have already heard about this cafe , and also about Mr. Rick himself .
Thank you . It is a pleasure to have you here , Major .
Champagne and a tin of caviar .
Especially so tonight , Major . In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers .
I expected no less , Captain .
Rick , this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich .
How do you do , Mr. Rick ?
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others .
Well , personally , Major , I will take what comes .
Rick is completely neutral about everything . And that takes in the field of women , too .
You were n't always so carefully neutral . We have a complete dossier on you .
Of course , one must admit he has great courage .
I admit he is very clever . Three times he slipped through our fingers . In Paris he continued his activities . We intend not to let it happen again .
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine . I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly .
If Rick has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .
As to Laszlo , we want him watched twenty-four hours a day .
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here .
You see , Captain , the situation is not as much under control as you believe .
My dear Major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we can not regulate the feelings of our people .
Uh , huh . I have been thinking . It is too dangerous if we let him go . It may be too dangerous if we let him stay .
I see what you mean .
Yes , much too good a time . The place is to be closed .
But I have no excuse to close it .
What is the meaning of that phone call ?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane .
You know , I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne , maybe get her on the rebound , eh ?
When it comes to women , you 're a true democrat .
The plane to Lisbon . You would like to be on it ?
Why ? What 's in Lisbon ?
It was a combination of all three .
And what in heaven 's name brought you to Casablanca ?
My health . I came to Casablanca for the waters .
Waters ? What waters ? We 're in the desert .
If you are thinking of warning him , do n't put yourself out . He can not possibly escape .
I stick my neck out for nobody .
How observant you are . As a matter of fact , I wanted to give you a word of advice .
Yeah ? Have a brandy ?
Rick , that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed .
Well , he 's succeeded in impressing half the world .
It is my duty to see that he does n't impress the other half . Rick , Laszlo must never reach America . He stays in Casablanca .
It 'll be interesting to see how he manages .
This is the end of the chase .
Twenty thousand francs says it is n't .
It does n't matter . There is no exit visa for him .
Louis , whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape ?
The winning side would have paid you much better .
Maybe . Well , it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here .
That makes Rick a citizen of the world .
I was born in New York City if that 'll help you any .
Serves me right for asking a direct question . The subject is closed .
Well , it looks like you 're a little late .
So Yvonne 's gone over to the enemy .
Who knows ? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front . I think it 's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little . I 'll see you later , Rick .
Why do you interfere with my little romances ?
Put it down as a gesture to love .
How can you close me up ? On what grounds ?
I am shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !
Well , they 're all excellent reasons .
Do n't count too much on my friendship , Ricky . In this matter I 'm powerless . Besides , I might lose ten thousand francs .
I see . How do I know you 'll keep your end of the bargain ?
I 'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor 's pen .
You know , this place will never be the same without you , Ricky .
Yes , I know what you mean , but I 've already spoken to Ferrari . You 'll still win at roulette .
I suppose you know what you 're doing , but I wonder if you realize what this means ?
I do . We 've got plenty of time to discuss that later .
If you do n't mind , you fill in the names . That will make it even more official .
You think of everything , do n't you ?
Well I was right . You are a sentimentalist .
Stay where you are . I do n't know what you 're talking about .
I suppose you know this is n't going to be pleasant for either of us , especially for you . I 'll have to arrest you of course .
As soon as the plane goes , Louis .
Well , Rick , you 're not only a sentimentalist , but you 've become a patriot .
Maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .
Come on , we 're going to get your coat .
Take your hands off me !
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation .
There seems to be no secret about that .
Are you one of those people who can not imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris ?
It 's not particularly my beloved Paris .
Well , there are certain sections of New York , Major , that I would n't advise you to try to invade .
Aha . Who do you think will win the war ?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
In this case , you have no sympathy for the fox , huh ?
You 'll excuse me , gentlemen . Your business is politics . Mine is running a saloon .
Good evening , Mr. Blaine .
I would advise you not to interfere .
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault , and I 'm willing to shoot you .
Huh . You know , Rick , watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank , one would think you 'd been doing this all your life .
Well , what makes you think I have n't ?
I forgot . You never drink with I 'll have another , please . You despise me , do n't you ?
If I gave you any thought , I probably would .
But think of all the poor devils who can not meet Renault 's price . I get it for them for half . Is that so parasitic ?
I do n't mind a parasite . I object to a cut-rate one .
Well , Rick , after tonight I 'll be through with the whole business , and I am leaving finally this Casablanca .
Who did you bribe for your visa ? Renault or yourself ?
Perhaps an hour , perhaps a little longer .
I do n't want them here overnight .
Sam , Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot .
I like it fine here .
He 'll double what I pay you .
Yeah , but I ai n't got time to spend the money I make here .
Well , I ai n't sleepy either .
Good . Then have a drink .
Boss , let 's get out of here .
No , sir . I 'm waiting for a lady .
Please , boss , let 's go . Ai n't nothing but trouble for you here .
She 's coming back . I know she 's coming back .
We 'll take the car and drive all night . We 'll get drunk . We 'll go fishing and stay away until she 's gone .
Shut up and go home , will you ?
Well , stop it . You know what I want to hear .
No , I do n't .
You played it for her and you can play it for me .
Well , I do n't think I can remember it .
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied , does n't it , Mr. Richard ?
You said it ! Here 's looking at you , kid .
And getting closer every minute . Here . Drink up . We 'll never finish the other three .
The Germans 'll be here pretty soon now , and they 'll come looking for you . And do n't forget there 's a price on your head .
Where is she ? Have you seen her ?
No , Mr. Richard . I ca n't find her .
Okay look , I know you 're tired , I know you 're thirsty , but give it one more shot , you 've just got to do a little more .
Do too much , I 'll die .
If they ca n't see you , what 's the point ?
Survive today , that 's the point .
Polaris , where are you ? Maybe I 'm too far south .
You do n't know where you are . You missed the shipping lanes .
You fucking bleeding heart , you kill or you die .
Why do they have to die for me ?
Look , just slip off the raft . The ocean would feel so good , the water 's so soft and warm . Take a little swim . Sleep .
You quitter you quitter you quitter .
The sea is lovely , dark and deep .
But I have promises to keep . And miles to go before I sleep . And miles to go before I sleep . Got to fix the sea anchor . Use the sail .
That 's death knocking , knocking on your door . Crazy little woman come knocking , knocking at my front door
Grow up , stop being such a baby . Other people get through a lot worse .
What are you smiling about ? They 'll be back .
I 'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel . With Kelly .
I float . You sink . End of story .
I 'm serious . I 'm always going on about me , me , me . Enough about me . Your turn .
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day ? The next day we just start over again .
It matters . We do the best we can , that 's all we have .
You came on a bicycle ? No wonder it 's so late .
There was an unavoidable delay .
Hmm . Feels like it might have gotten wet .
Possible . So you did those wings ?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient .
He was a sorry sonofabitch , and I 'm sorry I ever married him .
I ca n't believe this . I I They are You 're a gifted artist . You 're into something very powerful . Primal . Truly .
Well , not really , I
To tell you the truth you did .
Do you have any more packages to deliver ?
No . that was the last one .
Just sit here , I 'll get us some lunch .
Did you really steal a crippled kid 's bicycle to make your deliveries , or is that just some bullshit story ?
I did n't steal it , and he was n't crippled .
What brings you out to the sticks ?
Had a package to deliver .
My last chapter 's in there , and the damn machine 's jammed .
Let 's take a look .
Got to follow the paper path here .
Chuck , forget the Xerox . So Russia did n't turn out well ?
Ah , the staff meeting could have gone better .
Let me guess , Russia came up ?
I ca n't even keep fish alive .
A puppy 's got a little more personality than a fish .
I have to go . I 'm on call for overflow down at the Hub .
A ring . I wanted a ring .
Look , I love the puppy . I love you . But I have to go .
You ca n't go now .
I 'm sorry about the presents . I got a little carried away .
No , it was great . Maybe a little overkill
Why did n't you come over , get mad at me , tell me what a stupid bitch I was .
I guess I had n't thought through how I felt .
Chuck , you 're breaking my heart .
A week , max . Okay ? Okay ?
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry
Hey hey it 's okay !
Right back , you said you 'd be right back .
A few things came up . Or went down .
If I 'd known you were alive
I would have done the same thing .
All that time I waited to go on a cruise , and you went without me .
Yeah , well could n't be helped .
The tide came in , the tide went out . I survived . That 's the headline . I survived .
Do n't overwhelm me with the details . You know how I hate that .
So simple to say , so hard to do .
Not when you have no choice .
You hated being alone . Could n't stand it . Busy every minute . Always plugged into something .
I did n't know what really being alone was . No one back here does .
I 've got to get back to Memphis . Hannah 's babysitter has finals .
It means a lot that you came .
Sorry sorry Why do my joints still ache ?
Dehydration . Vitamin deficiency . Protein deficiency . Any or all of the above .
All I ate was fish . That 's solid protein .
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage .
I used to drive one of those . A long time ago .
Hey , once a driver , always a driver . You want a lift ? I 've just got one more pickup .
It seemed like she had such a good time last time .
It 's nothing you did , Mom , believe me .
Look , I help take care of the place . You got my check , did n't you Mom ?
That new roof , that 's your doing .
Mom , this is a farm . We 've got real strawberries growing outside , we 've got real cream .
Oh no , the prodigal son 's home . We bring out the store bought .
Maybe I should take a few days off . Roger 's working now , you could use some help around here
Do n't you even think about it .
Doing great , Mom , do n't worry about me .
There 's settled folks , and there 's nomads . You 're just not a settled folk . You never belonged here .
I 've got all this back pay coming . Why do n't you let me get you a place in town ?
This is my home . I 'm part of the wallpaper .
What a journey you 've had . It seems more than a person should have to bear .
The tide saved me , Mom . I lived by it . I 'm just wondering where it will take me next .
What do you expect , from the guy who stole a kid 's bicycle when his truck broke down ?
Borrowed . I borrowed it .
I checked the weather , you had the jet stream , you could have made it up .
But I might not have .
Every person counts , every package counts , that 's my point .
You know what your problem is ? You just see the packages in front of you . You do n't see the big picture .
That 's why you 're a gambling man .
That 's why I 'm running foreign and you 're not . That 's why you 're not married and I am .
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month .
Ninety five percent ? Just give me the money now .
Malaysia 's tanking . We 're meeting in ten in operations .
Right . Get me everything on Indonesia , New Guinea , all the way to Australia .
Must have taken a hell of a long time .
Time I had lots of .
When I first showed up , I thought you 'd lost your fucking marbles .
I never thought it would end . Then it did . It was so great to be saved , I could n't stop laughing .
I 'm serious . The burning bush , the big picture , the words in neon
What 's it all about ? It 's about being so thirsty you 'd crush a fish 's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that 's what it 's about .
You want that delivered , we 'll deliver it . That 's what we do .
I need to do it .
May I ask , where are you bound ?
San Francisco . And you ?
I was dreaming about you . How beautiful you were !
You were n't dreaming about me .
He 'll need clothes some money
Let him try to make some money ! That 's part of seeing the world , is n't it ?
Oh , just stop it ! You knew this was going to happen . He 's a young man .
He 's still a boy out in the world , he 's still a boy .
You invented him ! You 've completely made his up !
Do n't you understand ? The board is going to replace me ! That 's what the new blood is for !
He sniffs that ether ! I 've seen him do it !
It 's because he 's too tired to sleep . He has to .
He smells like he could put you to sleep !
He 's a doctor , Buster doctors smell like ether .
You 're a doctor , Homer you do n't smell like ether .
I 'm not a doctor . I have n't been to medical school I have n't even been to high school !
But you 've studied with the old man for years !
I 'm not a doctor !
Yeah . But sometimes I wish I could meet mine , anyway .
What for , Buster ? What would you do if you met them ?
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone .
I doubt it . She 's just an
What are you going to tell the little ones ?
I 'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted .
Why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him ?
They 'll believe it because they want to believe it .
Daddy , it 's a letter to me .
He mentions Homer , too , you know .
I 'm a little worried about the about how much bleeding is okay .
It should taper off tomorrow , but it can come back again . You have cramps ? They 'll ease up , almost entirely . As long as the bleeding is n't heavy , it 's normal .
I guess I 'll see you around the orchards . Thanks for everything .
Sure I 'll see you around .
People watched the movies in their cars ?
When they watched at all . Do you like movies ?
You 've seen only one movie ? Which one ?
King Kong . It 's really good .
But you looked as if you liked it .
I did like it . All I said was , It 's not 'King Kong ' .
First she loved him , then she did n't , then no one else could have him
She did love him ! How many women have you known ?
And what did she die of , exactly ?
She was torn apart ! She died of a broken heart .
You 're a natural . You were born to drive a car like this .
You think ? Maybe I was . I love this place !
The screen is enormous ! Imagine King Kong up there ! Have you seen a lot of movies here ?
Yes and no . When you come here , you do n't really care about the movie .
How could you not care about the movie ?
You just cuddle . You come to hug to kiss . You do n't come here to watch the movie .
That 's what I 'd come here for . I 'd watch the movie .
Not with the right girl you would n't .
Are n't you worried that people will cut their feet ?
Nobody will swim here until next summer . By then , the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there wo n't be any sharp edges .
Olive told me . You might have told me yourself .
I 'm just waiting and seeing . Like you said .
Do you think I 'm having a good time ? Do you think I 'm just teasing you ? Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally ?
So we should wait and see . For how long ?
I grew up with Wally . I began my adult life with him .
Fine . That 's all there is to it then .
No ! That 's not all there is to it ! I love you , too I know I do .
Okay , okay I know you do , too .
We should take her to St . Cloud 's . That much is obvious , is n't it ? Let her make up her mind when she gets there
I told her ! She does n't feel she can do that . Something about her father not letting her go anywhere
She wo n't go to St . Cloud 's !
Well , we ca n't force her . It 's her decision .
Is n't that like waiting and seeing ?
No . Nothing is nothing . I want Wally to come home . I 'm afraid to see him , too .
Please do n't move , do n't go anywhere .
Go anywhere ? Of course not ! That would be doing something , would n't it ? We would n't want to do something . Let 's just sit here all night !
Stop it ! Just cut it out !
You got up ! You did something ! If you keep this up , you might be in danger of making a decision !
He 's alive . He still loves you . So do I .
What do you want me to do ?
Please do n't make me say it again .
No , that 's not it I just want to be sure I understand you .
And now that Wally 's coming back , and because he 'll certainly need you
You say that as though it 's some awful thing ! I never stopped loving Wally !
Do you think she 'll be all right ?
She knows how to take care of herself .
I know you do n't think much of being needed , or of me for that matter
I 'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you . It was unnecessary .
No , I 'm the one who should be sorry . You have every right to be angry .
No . You warned me . I did n't listen , but you warned me .
I 've got some more clothes for you I just keep forgetting to bring them with me .
I do n't need no more clothes , thank you .
I know where you can go . Homer and I can take you
I ca n't go nowhere .
You can trust me . Is it Jack ? It 's not Jack , is it ? It 's Muddy ! Is it Muddy ?
No . It ai n't Muddy . Muddy 's just
So many children . Are they all orphans ?
Well , this is an orphanage .
I 'm okay I can walk .
I do n't want you to walk I want to carry you . Should I put the top up ? It might get cold .
You said , Apples are n't exactly flying .
Well , they are n't .
There ! You said it was boring .
Well , picking them is ! It 's about as exciting as walking !
I was just showing Homer the orchards kind of a geography lesson .
I know what you 've been doing .
You 've been giving him a flying lesson !
He loved it ! Did n't you ?
He thinks people like to get whacked by branches .
Homer liked it ! Did n't you ?
You 're one of the best , Curly we could n't let just anyone take you .
Dr. Larch would n't let just anyone take any of us !
Her temperature is a hundred and four .
How old are you , dear ? Thirteen ?
You mean they 'll replace you with someone who wo n't perform abortions .
Well , we can only guess about that , Edna . They are against the law .
So here is my candidate . What do you think ?
But what about school records ? Homer does n't have any diplomas
Or that he ca n't be bothered to write us a proper letter ? A dissertation on apples , we do n't need !
He probably does n't make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them , too .
Homer does n't King Kong think the woman is his mother ?
Uh , sure that 's what Kong thinks , all right .
I was a posthumous child . My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it .
His father 's dead , right ?
Do n't get too excited , Fuzzy .
Why ca n't we have pumpkins for Christmas , too ? We do n't get any good presents at Christmas , anyway .
It looks like you bit it it 'll be all right .
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me .
No , you did it yourself . Maybe in your sleep .
I must have been dreaming of kissing someone .
I 'm sorry . They 're not used to seeing a car like this .
It 's okay I do n't mind .
So , now , uh you 're not I mean , do you do the
No . Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure .
They would n't take me . I 'm Class IV I 've got a heart defect .
Really ! Is it serious ?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat ?
Actually , someone did . I just did n't think I could eat anything .
I wonder if you might give me a ride .
Sure ! Be glad to ! Uh a ride where ?
No , I 'm not . I need a job .
The only jobs are picking jobs . Picking apples is truly boring .
This is all normal . Do n't worry . The abortion procedure it affects you . It 's the ether , too . It 'll take a little time .
I do n't have any time . There 's a war !
Burma run because you fly over Burma
And over the Himalayas . That 's called flying over the hump .
Uh , look if you 're serious about wanting a job , picking apples is n't that boring .
Oh , I would love that , Wally .
You 're the one who 's helping me , Homer . You 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I 'm gone . Candy , too .
Well , sure that 's good , then . All I mean is , I 'm lucky I met you .
So . What should I do now ?
Out back , there 's a shed . It 's just a mess . If that shed was better organized , I could put my truck in there .
Are we supposed to be up here ? The rules said
Homer , you the only one who 's read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he 's doin ' somethin ' wrong .
Slow down , Homer do n't be in such a big hurry .
This is easy I 'm not hurrying .
I think you been stayin ' up too late at night , Homer .
You 're actually having sex with your own little girl ? Is that possible ?
Ai n't nobody havin ' sex with my little girl , Homer that 's somethin ' a father knows .
You 're lying . How can you with your own daughter !
Homer , do n't you know what business you in ? You do n't wan na go into no business with me , Homer ai n't that right ?
Go on , cut my clothes . I 've got other clothes .
Please listen to me ! Both of you
You forget yourself , Homer . This here 's my daughter ! You got your own mess to deal with ai n't that right ?
What business is you in , Homer ?
Mr. Rose , I 'm in the doctor business . If you want , I can help you . You do n't have to go anywhere .
I presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery .
All I said was , I do n't want to perform abortions . I have no argument with you performing them .
You know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they ca n't get help anywhere else ?
One : it 's illegal . Two : I did n't ask how to do it you just showed me .
If you take enough of it , your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C .
In other words , scurvy .
I have n't , either . But you will . The morons who write the books should do a little research here .
But is n't Fuzzy just well , underdeveloped ?
Henceforth you shall be Little Wilbur .
I 'm not crazy about the Little
Okay , he 's just a Wilbur then .
We have n't had a Wilbur here in a year or so , have we ? We used to have dozens !
I thought you took care of this . It always breaks in the same place . It 's your splice , is n't it ?
It 's your splice ! You blame me for everything !
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with ?
How about this child ? You expect her to be responsible ?
It 's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people .
I 'm happy I amuse you .
Try to look at it this way . What choice does Buster have ? What are his options ? Nobody will ever adopt him .
Try to look at it this way . Buster and I are sitting right here beside you . We could have ended up in the incinerator !
Doubtless you 'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do .
I was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless I expect I 'll find some ways to be of use .
I do n't need this I know all about my condition .
It 's your heart you ought to take it with you .
What I mean is I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here , Homer .
Mrs. Worthington , I feel I 'm very lucky to be here .
I think Wally will be fine , Mrs. Worthington he seems indestructible to me .
I do n't know . Just promise me one thing .
Do n't mess in this , Homer , if you know what 's good for you .
How long 's this been going on , Muddy ?
One : Please do n't smoke in bed .
We heard that one already , Homer .
Thanks , guys I 'd like to go with you . But I 've got to move on .
Yeah , well you could move on with us , man ! You could move on somewhere warm !
Give men that . I know how to do it .
Oh , I suppose you are a doctor , Homer ?
You 're not yet three months , are you ?
Not yet . What do you know about it ?
I know more than I want to know about it . Who 's the father ?
Do n't trouble yourself about it , Homer this ai n't your business .
But you do n't look very happy .
Happy ! What are you thinkin ' ? How am I supposed to take care of a baby ! I ca n't have a baby .
What I mean is , if you do n't want to keep the baby , I know a place where you can go .
You think Daddy 's gon na let me go anywhere ? I ai n't going nowhere .
Why do n't you just go back to your pickin ' , Homer ? I can take care of it myself !
Rose , listen do n't do anything . You know , I mean to yourself . Please listen
Shit . We do n't know what he is .
Jack , you got ta watch your language 'round my daughter .
That just ai n't right , Jack your cigarette 's gon na end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider ! That ai n't right .
Them people drinkin ' that cider , they do n't know there 's a cigarette in there !
It 's not that hard to find it in there , Jack it 'll take you just a minute . You just got ta go fishin ' .
You mean swimmin ' . I ai n't goin ' in that vat to fish out no cigarette !
I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here !
Anyway , I was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available I did n't think you 'd be interested .
They told me I was too old to serve .
They told Muddy his feet was too flat !
Ai n't you gon na see what it is , Homer ?
Mind your own business , Peaches .
You all take care of yourself , too , Homer !
We see you next harvest .
Do n't this place look like home ?
It look nicer then home !
You pickin ' nothin ' but cider apples , Peaches I hope you understand that .
They ai n't drops I picked 'em off the tree !
Do n't let us make you nervous or nothin ' we know you got ta job to do .
Yeah , we can wait all night for the water to come back on you just go on and take your time .
It 's that Vernon he keeps askin ' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at .
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business , Muddy .
I told him that you all is sick .
Tell him what you want , Muddy you are the crew boss today .
That what happen you lost you only daughter so 's you killed yourself ! That 's what we say , all right .
That 's right . I know you understand how I feel , Homer you are breakin ' them rules , too . Ai n't that right ?
Daddy , I 'd like to be in that Wally 's shoes every night .
You lucky you in your work boots tonight , girl
That sounds like you are in trouble already , Homer .
That 's right that sounds like trouble to me .
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat !
Now , now , darlin ' Jack just needs to know what business he 's in .
Yeah , you really showed him , Daddy you just about cut your own hand off , and all you cut off him was his clothes !
You oughta know you do n't go to jail for cuttin ' a guy 's clothes . Ai n't that right , Homer ?
Now , now , Jack that just ai n't right .
You just stay out of trouble , Homer !
Where do you think you 're going ?
You got ta let me go , Daddy . Please
You ai n't goin ' nowhere in the middle of the night , girl !
I ai n't your business no more , Daddy . Please let me go .
You just go inside , Homer . We do n't need no help .
That 's right , Homer . This ai n't your business .
That Candy she 's the nicest girl I know !
She 's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen I do n't know if she 's the nicest .
You 're lucky he did n't cut your nipples off , man .
The good news , Jack , is you 're half-undressed for swimmin '
You ever see a palm tree , Homer ?
He ai n't never been outta Maine !
But I 'm not that late . You did n't have to give away my seat .
I was n't sure if you 'd make it .
Brutal day . They say the streets are lined with money down here , but I guess you have to know the secret handshake . What are you drinking ?
Uh , Maker 's Mark . Rocks .
My name 's Grant . Grant Ashby .
Oh god . I 'm overbearing and rude . Lily . Lily Finn .
So we 've been meeting with banks all day . It 's amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word .
Well , typically , corporate loans are relatively simple matters , but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery .
Do n't tell me you started a tech firm here before us .
No , no . Nothing like that . I work in a bank .
Oh . Well , thanks for the drink .
You 're welcome . I was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us .
Uh , right And that was it . That 's when we decided to start our own business . No more shithead bosses .
I envy you guys . Taking a chance like that .
What do you do over at your bank , Grant ?
What do I do ? I 'm the VP of Finance .
Here 's where a little research comes in handy . Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars . It 's a small lie , but now we 're sure he 's playing .
Maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan .
Well , typically speaking , they 're not . As long as you can demonstrate
A capacity for gross fund recovery . Yeah , we got that part .
Listen , what I 'm about to tell you , I 'm telling you in confidence , okay ? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com ?
Big.Com . That Internet thing .
Same thing with playing a con . You have to be able to see that deep .
Jake ? Right . Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah , it 's going through
Hey , Jake When am I gon na get to play the Inside ?
Gordo plays the inside . You 're the Shill .
And I think it 's because of this redhead
Know who I am , Jake ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you , Jake .
Gee What makes you say that ?
I 'm not saying anything . Besides , you 're one to talk . You 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley .
And these cops ? What do they get ?
Keep going . I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby .
So you want to know how to play the Big Con .
I can see why you liked her .
That was it . We had our crew . Now we needed the Mark .
Is that what it was , Jake ? Was it love ?
You know when the first con was ever played ? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden .
So much for honor among thieves . You would have cut loose your friends , your girl
I was doing it for them .
Alrlght , alrlght . What happened today ?
Today ? Started off great
Alright Turn around . She does n't get shit , unless I get that money . Where is it ?
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government .
Oh , Jake . You disappoint me . And you just let Lily here down again . What was it you said about playing the big con ?
It 's like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .
Independent . Same shit , just independent . They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book Big . Fat . Bald .
So what ? We hide , right ?
Fuck that . We 're going too .
Alright , let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . Is this the best thing to do ?
This might just be me , but that is hands down , the dumbest fucking idea I 've ever heard .
People have tried this before , Jake . It 's never worked . Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it . Last year , Mumps got pinched in L.A .
The red hair It 's bad luck .
It 's not like she 's a real redhead , Jake
Poor bastard never knew what hit him . Jesus , I almost felt sorry for the guy .
I got ta work off some of this adrenaline . I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn . Anybody want in ?
That 's it ? What are you talking about ? We can still do this !
Jake , I mean , come on
What ? I can feel you looking at me .
That 's a lot of cash . He came up with it pretty quick .
It can buy you a new and better you .
I just do n't know if this says , me . What 's the fabric ?
You know what we 're doing with the money .
And what about Big Al ?
You got ta be kidding me . Her ?
Yes , her . Where 's my wallet ?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty .
We get fifty percent . And we get clear of the King .
We 're going to make it back , Grant . Three or four times over .
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy ?
What ? No . Use the bathroom on the plane !
Grifter huh ? Where have you been on the grift ? Could n't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you , Skippy .
Jake . You can call me Jake . Here and there .
I guess it lacks a certain style .
Of course , your line of work 's only as good as the people you find .
You ca n't cheat an honest man .
You ca n't cheat an honest man . But a man like Lionel Dolby
Honest mistake . Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven .
I ca n't do that .
Buddy , that was business . Besides , you have more crew . Then there 's you
I 'll get the money back , plus interest . I go on the grift for you . You get a cat , I get a cut . And we get square .
What do you need from me ? Permission ? Go ! If you can fleece him for two million , then do it , Kid .
I need you to stake me .
That 's more than you already owe me . What happens if you fuck this up ?
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
Look at you , you skinny prick .
You 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything , are you ?
That tip not work-out for you fellas ?
Tip was fine , Jake . We were a little more curious about the Fed .
Special Agent Gunther Moonan . Ring a bell ?
Gunther ? I think I 'd remember a Gunther .
Kennedy . International terminal . Gordo with a black suitcase . You got Moonan under control ?
Do n't worry about Moonan . We got him covered . When ? It was him . There 's a shipment coming through tonight . Kennedy .
Of course . Jake . Nice to see you .
Well , it certainly is a coincidence . Here of all places ! How is Mrs. Lewis ?
What brings you down from Boston , Jake ? Taking advantage of the long weekend ?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation .
We have work . It pays a lot . Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up .
Oooh . Sassy . What do you care who feels me up , Jake ? Unless it kinda gotcha going . Did it , Jake ? Getcha going ?
Alright ! Hold up . You win . You got the job .
Gee thanks . Now I do n't have to find that bridge to jump off .
We had to see what your deal was . I 'm just a little superstitious .
Here 's my deal Do n't waste my time . What do you want me for anyway ? You do n't even know me .
Hey , I 'm not just along for the ride , so I do n't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
Take a deep breath . You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something .
You told me to change my hair !
What about this ? Do you have any idea what this means ? You 've killed us . We 're dead !
We 're getting down to the wire . Apparently another company has a similar product in R & D right now . If they beat us to it
Off the record , I 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it 'd help .
Look at you You want to go .
For what ? A couple hundred bucks ?
I think you 'd do it for free . You 're almost drooling . You like the rush .
It 's what I do . It 's my job .
Why ? Your mother not breast feed you or something ?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove ?
Whatever . But you I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything . So why this ?
I 'm good at it . Lying , cheating , manipulating I 'm good at it .
So that was my part ? Smile and shake my ass ?
No . You have another part ? You 'll know what to do .
You have really soft hands . Like a baby 's .
Do n't ruin this for me .
We were friends . I trusted him . I should have known it was weird . But , then again I was weird .
You guys got busted . This is a great neck .
No . You trusted him You were just getting square .
You know why I told you that , Jake ? Because I trust you too .
You are such a raving pussy sometimes .
Hey , we fucked once , honey . That hardly makes you a good judge of character . And do n't think I did n't know you were working some angle with that either .
So there it is . You got that big itch you need to scratch . It 's all about the fucking money . What do you want , an apology ?
No , I want my cut !
What do you get , Lily ? Finder 's Fee ? Because it is all about the money , right ?
You sold me out . You should have trusted me like I trusted you . You fucked up . You fucked up HUGE .
You tell them the Tale .
What do you want ? An apology ?
Do we want insurance ? I 'm just asking
Just mail it to the hospital . Mr. King , please . It 's regarding an accounting problem . Yes Correct I know where it is . That will be fine . Thank you .
You better hurry . The police will be here any second . I do n't really understand my motivation with this . Why am I washing glasses ?
Now you 're an accomplice in a homicide . Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg .
No . Big con . One rag . One rag and we get out from under all this . But we need another Shill .
What do we need another Shill for ?
Then what do you want to do , Miles ? Run ?
We never had a problem with that before .
We 're getting a little old for running .
Yeah , well we 're still a little young for Albany State Prison . Are you pissed about Al ? I 'm pissed too , but I 'm not like twenty-five to life pissed .
But if you wan na talk about bad luck
Where the hell is she ?
Feeling lucky today , Miles . Found a penny Heads up . There was an empty cab right outside my building . We hit every green light .
And we got rid of the red head .
Excuse me ? I believe you 're holding something far me under Pearson .
Do you have a ticket ?
I 'm sorry . Nothing under Pearson .
You 're sure ? This is Just a complete disaster .
A ring for my wife . A lot like that one . In fact , it was that one .
That 's no problem . We have those in stock .
When this is all over , you 're going to tell me who the King put on Al .
You going to have the time ?
King ai n't gon na like this .
Do n't worry , I 'll settle up with your boss . We have n't skipped town yet .
Can I speak to you in confidence ?
Huh ? Oh . She 's alright .
Coupla things . They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split .
A Fed ? Is he close ?
So do half the other people in this place . How do I know which one ?
I got it figured out He 's got this thing with bathrooms . If he makes it through Customs , he 'll be heading for the john .
If you Feds are so hot for him , why do n't we just bring him in right now ?
I want him for something big and to do that , we have to catch him in the act .
Like we told you before , we think he 's into something with the King Pin
Look , I 'm not a confrontational person by nature .
Good I got ta go . So , what do you have for me ?
Whaddya mean ? We got dick .
Hope so . Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me . One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up . One fifty ! It 's not even covered .
It 's cosmetic . They do n't cover cosmetic . Last year I had a tooth capped . The dentist tells me I 'm not covered for caps . It 's cosmetic .
Bullshit it 's cosmetic ! My fucking tooth was cracked in half . I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity . The department 's dental is for shit .
Whoa , whoa There he is .
Can you ? I 'm happy being a dealer . At least the punters keep their hands to themselves .
You called the casino a cesspit .
You fucking little shit ! You shopped me .
What are you talking about ?
Reynolds got a doctor in . They forced me to take a dope test . It was positive . As you knew .
I do n't know anything about it .
What are you laughing at ? Who was that on the phone ?
A couple I know are getting married .
What kind of deal you looking to ?
What 's the Blue Book price ?
I thought it was you . It 's the hair !
I 'm working on that soccer story .
How 's that football story corning along ?
You said it was going to be social , Giles . No business .
You should n't have done that . I know what it meant to you .
I owe you for the rent . It 's only a car . I can get another .
Take it back . Till you sell your book .
Come on , Marion . Let 's face the truth . Nobody 's going to publish it .
In a casino . As a croupier . A dealer .
How did you land that ?
It came my way . 450 a week .
450 ? What did you do , just walked in and said I want to be a croupier ? Do n't you need training ?
I had training . In the Republic .
You were a croupier there ? You never told me that . I thought you just knew some gamblers .
You sold the car . You got a job . What 's the third thing ? Tell me .
There 's no third thing . Do n't be superstitious .
Are you trying to read my palm ?
You 've got such beautiful hands .
You 're shaking . What is it ?
Tension . It 'll go .
When you get home , I 'm asleep . When I leave home , you 're asleep .
I 'll see you in my dreams .
Where 've you been ? I 've got to give evidence in court at nine .
Do n't play the cop with me , Marion .
Take that back ! Fucking take that back . I 'm not a cop any more .
I take it back . You 're not a cop any more . You 're a store detective .
This fucking job 's getting to you . You have n't written a fucking word since you started .
Do you have to swear all the time ?
What are you doing here ? You know the rules .
What about a drink on the way home ?
I do n't finish till eight . Make it nine and you 're on .
I 'm on at nine .
I do n't like it at all . You had a wonderful character before , the Gambler . He was so romantic .
He was a loser . This guy 's a croupier . He ca n't lose . People have shat on him all his life . Now he 's in control . He 's a winner .
Are n't you ever tempted to gamble ?
Never . Why do you ask ?
I 'm curious about Bourne . Your interpretation of his condition . You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions ?
Am I a doctor , no , but
Not good enough . You 're the person who floated this amnesia story . Ever feel sorry for him ? For what he 'd been through ?
You 're making it out like we 're friends here or something . I met him alone twice .
You felt nothing ? No spark ? Two young people in Paris ? Dangerous missions ? Life and death ?
You mean , did I want a date ?
What do you think ? Is he coming in ?
I do n't know . He was sick . He wanted out . I believed him .
We 're looking at all Berlin outbound . Good news is , every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed , digital security cameras . Common feed .
Are we hacking or asking ?
Then we 'll just have a peek at the wounds . Dig 'em up !
They 've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God 's church , and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation . So please do it .
We 'll sleep here tonight . You 'll come home with me . We 'll let the house , and the lands too ; plenty of willing neighbors .
I do n't want to leave .
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection ? Or was it all about Judgment ?
It was in Latin , sir .
A thousand . You have made me Guardian of Scotland . So I tell you this is what we face .
We must sue for peace .
Sir William . We come to seek a meeting .
You 've all sworn to Longshanks .
An oath to a liar is no oath at all . An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed . Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you .
So let the council swear publicly .
I will meet you , but only one way if Robert the Bruce is there , and puts his hand on my Bible , and swears his loyalty to Scotland .
He has already agreed to come .
May he rest in peace You have already sealed the coffin ?
He was a modest man .
If I pay homage to another 's throne , then how am I a king ?
Homage is nothing . It is the crown that matters !
The crown is that of Scotland . And Scotland is William Wallace .
That is another matter . There is a price to all this , required both by Longshanks and our nobles . Pay it , and you will be our king . And we will have peace .
Now we kill two birds at one stroke . We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France .
The Scots will fight for us ?
What choice do they have ? Now they must serve us or starve .
But if we have not caught Wallace
His legend grows ! It will be worse than before !
You let Wallace escape your whole army . You can not blame me for this .
